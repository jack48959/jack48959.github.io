For hundreds of years, the Celtic Trinity knot has served as a symbol of equality and power. Some say that the ancient Celtic people once associated its four points with the forces of earth, air, and water, or the triaid of the Mother, the Maiden, and the Crone. This historically-significant symbol looks great in any home
Our beautiful knocker comes with two fine yet sturdy mounting bolts, making the process of attaching it to your front door a simple, safe process. The installation instructions are clear and simple to read, too, making it easy to mount in no time at all
Our knocker measures approximately 5.5” by 5”, making it the perfect size to stand out on the surface of any front door, without dominating the majority of the entryway. It’s just the right size for the hand of any arriving guest to fit around in comfort
Our delightful Trinity Knot Door Knocker comes neatly pre-packaged in a beautiful presentation box, making it an excellent souvenir option for any friend or family member in your life with a special place for the Emerald Isle in their heart</p><p>Made from classic, vintage-style antique bronze and bearing the image of an intricate Celtic Trinity knot design, our gorgeous door knocker from Robert Emmet is the perfect way for visitors to your welcoming home to announce themselves with a cheerful knock, knock, knock! Elegantly tying back into the ancient time of the Celts in Ireland, the Trinity knot has long been viewed as a symbol of the precise and essential balance of power, be it in nature, among the forces of earth, air, and water, or in religion, as with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit components of God. No matter which approach you prefer, you’re guaranteed to be taken in by the depth of meaning and inherent beauty of this old Irish symbol when you hang it on your front door!</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Uu+nRCR0L._AC_SL1053_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/tools-home-improvement/iroda-ps6-32mm-angle-replacement-soldering-iron-tip-for-solderpro-100-110-120-150/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Iroda PS-6 3.2mm Angle Replacement Soldering Iron Tip for SOLDERPRO 100, 110, 120, 150">&larr;
