Everyone in your household will appreciate the added stability, especially older adults. Our carpet stair treads add comfort to wood, tile and other hard stair surfaces and help to protect them from damage. They also help soften noise throughout your home, which is perfect for lively children, dogs and other pets. Do Carpet Stair Treads Attach to Steps? Our attachable carpet stair treads feature a hook-and-loop fastening system to create a safer walking space for your family, guests and pets. Each individual stair tread comes with (4) adhesive-backed hooked-fiber strips that adhere to your step and (4) looped-fiber strips sewn into the back that attach to the hooked-fiber strips. The intentionally low profile design creates a firm grip with no added bulkiness, and none of the components will be seen from the top. The fastening system keeps the treads securely in place, but also allows for easy removal and reattachment as needed for cleaning. Are Carpet Stair Treads Pet Friendly? Your pets will appreciate the security of House Home & More carpet stair treads as much as you do! Walking up and down hard stair surfaces can be a fearful challenge for new puppies, senior dogsand aging cats. The soft surface of carpet stair treads will keep their paws cozy while the added traction helps to prevent slipping, allowing them to move with confidence. Our attachable stair treads help to create a safer environment for your household, including your pets. If you have pets, consider a carpet color or design that wonât showcase their shedding. How to Care for Your Carpet Stair Treads: Our attachable carpet stair treads feature a hook-and-loop fastening system which helps to keep them in place while vacuuming but will become damaged if put into a washing machine. Polyester is a naturally stain-resistant material, but when your attachable treads need cleaning, we recommend vacuuming with a handheld vacuum or hose attachment to remove surface dirt and spot cleaning areas that need extra care with mild soap and water. Before using any carpet cleaning product, test the product on an unnoticeable area to make sure it does not damage or fade your carpet.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KiLBx8N3L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
