BLOCK FUNCTION: Provides added hand safety while guiding wood for sawing and cutting - safety blocks allowing you to maintain a firm and steady downward pressure of the workpiece, without the bounce or chatter as it crosses the cutters blades.
STICK FUNCTION: Offers enhanced hand safety while guiding wood for sawing and cutting – the l-shaped stick (also called a v push stick) allows you to push the entire work piece through the blades, and the standard straight push stick is great when you have limited space - both are narrow and are useful when working with smaller stock.
APPLICATIONS: Push blocks are commonly used for face jointing, ripping plywood, routing and other woodworking applications and push sticks are commonly used in combination with jointers, tablesaws, router tables and shapers.
DELUXE GRIP: Features an easy grip ergonomic handle that’s safe, easy to work with and feels natural in the hand; This premium safety push block and stick package was designed for durability, maximum control and engineered with a safety first approach to woodworking.</p><p>Introducing the
Max Grip Push Block and Push Stick Set by POWERTEC
.
This well crafted and premium version safety orange push block & stick set includes 3 push blocks ( one long and two short ) and 2 push sticks ( one straight push stick and one v stick ). The V-shaped push stick ( sometimes called a V-type push stick or v-shaped putter ) is great when extruding, or needing to exert a more detailed control on your work piece, or if needing to get really close to the blade. The push blocks ( often called push pads ) are essential for use on routers, jointers and table saws. The straight push stick is great for narrow stock or when space is limited.
DELUXE GRIP/CRAFTSMANSHIP
Features an easy grip ergonomic handle that’s safe, easy to work with and feels natural in the hand; This premium safety push block and stick package was designed for durability, maximum control and engineered with a safety first approach to woodworking.
Safety Through and Through
Not only do they help keep your hands out of harms way, but they reduce the risk of kickback, often resulting in smoother cuts or general improvements in other applications, producing a more efficient and professional looking finish no matter how small or large the work. But essentially, they are used to help maintain a firm and consistent downward pressure on your stock or a more controlled ride through the cutting blade.
Simple and Effective Use
When the blocks are used at the leading end of your work-piece, these powerful, yet simplistic safety tools boast an impressive grip strength using it’s natural slip resistant friction pads, and help prevent scratching. The sticks make it so much easier to push your stock safely through the blades from the rear when that direction of control is called for. They’ll make it much easier to hold and grip as you guide/push wood through the cutting blade, whatever your desired application.
