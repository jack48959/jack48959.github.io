From the Manufacturer
The SharkBite push-fit fittings are the fastest, easiest way to join copper, CPVC, or PEX tubing in any combination. Each fitting increases ease of use while decreasing the time and effort needed to connect water distribution pipe. There is no glue, soldering or crimping needed. Simply cut your pipe, debar, mark the pipe approximately 1 (for proper insertion depth), install pipe to proper depth and you&rsquo;re done.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/811mxzUrpHL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
