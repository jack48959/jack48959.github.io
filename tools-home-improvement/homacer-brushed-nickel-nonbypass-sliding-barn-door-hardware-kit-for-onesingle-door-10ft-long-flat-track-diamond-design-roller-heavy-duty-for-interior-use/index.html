We picked the most premium brushed nickel steel to make the hardware heavy-duty and sturdier than the competition. The nickel powdered coating makes the paint stays forever and will not be scratched off. The wheels of the roller are made of high-quality nylon which ensures minimal noise when it glides on the track. Each hardware kit can hold a total door(s) weight up to 220 lbs.
üòäFULLY OPTIMIZED CONNECTING AND SPACING. I understand how frustrated it was when you opened the box and found out multiple smaller tracks that were hard to line up and connect. Even worse when the spacing was not exactly 16 inches. We‚Äôve got them all figured out! The spacing is now exactly 16 inches. Track 7.5ft and under is only one piece track. Track 8ft and above are connected by two tracks using a junction plate, thus, the spacing between the middle two holes may not be 16 inches.

Please also notify us to put spacer extensions in the package if you have thicker doors. The spacer extension will extend the track further from the wall to fit the thicker door.</li><li>If you have a door trim, you‚Äôd better put a header board that is as thick as the trim and then attach the hardware to the header board.</li><li>From the top of the door to the ceiling, you need to have at least 6 Inches clearance for the single track bypass hardware kit.</li><li>All tracks that are 7.5FT and under come in one piece.
