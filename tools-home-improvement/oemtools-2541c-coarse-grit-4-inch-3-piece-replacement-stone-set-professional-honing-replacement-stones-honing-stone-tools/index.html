Keeping your engine running smoothly requires a lot of maintenance, but the cylinder walls can be a breeze to maintain with the OEMTOOLS 2541C Coarse Grit 4 Inch 3 Piece Replacement Stone Set. This honing tool kit includes 3 replacement stones for deglazing the walls of your vehicleâ€™s cylinders. This will ensure oil will run more smoothly through the engine instead of getting caught in crevasses. While the stones deglaze the cylinders, you can be sure you will have a smooth surface each time as the stones are designed to prevent cutting. Constructed of chrome vanadium steel, these honing stones are built to last, proving strength and durability. Because the set comes with pins, it is simple to attach the stones to the arms of the cylinder hone deglazer. You never know when youâ€™ll need another set of stones, so be prepared with this set. The OEMTOOLS 2541C Coarse Grit 4 Inch 3 Piece Replacement Stone Set is the tool set youâ€™ll want to keep in your toolbox.
