These machining processes produce bits that are perfectly concentric with very little wobble. They drill accurate diameter holes, require less energy to power through wood creating less heat.
Made from high-carbon S55C steel specially designed for Woodowl bits with cutting heads induction hardened to 58 HRC.</p><p>Wood Owl, located in Miki, Japan, has specialized in the production of drill and auger bits for the woodworking industry since 1923. While the factory is highly mechanized, many of the operations are still performed by hand by highly skilled workers. These bits are classified as Combination Spurred Ship Auger Bits. They have a single flute, single cutting head with a single spur (the outer cutting edge that scores the outside of the hole). They cut very cleanly as the spur scores the outside edge of the hole before the cutter head clears material. They have an outside spur and can be damaged if they hit a nail. These bits cut very fast due to the single flute design which provides efficient chip ejection. They are hand sharpened which also enhances cutting speed. These bits are not cast or forged but milled and ground from solid round blanks. The sharp lead screws are also precision ground and machined allowing these bits to start immediately into wood once the drill is started. These machining processes produce bits that are perfectly concentric with very little wobble. They drill accurate diameter holes, require less energy to power through wood and create less heat. They will also drill straight and true through all types of wood with minimal wandering. These bits are made from high-carbon S55C steel specially designed for Woodowl bits. Cutting heads are fully induction hardened to 58 HRC. The flutes have a phosphate coating (Parkerizing) to facilitate chip ejection and to protect from corrosion. These bits can be used in cordless or corded drills and hand braces. These bits can be resharpened using a Woodowl feather sharpening file.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31dgyXD7tyL._SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
