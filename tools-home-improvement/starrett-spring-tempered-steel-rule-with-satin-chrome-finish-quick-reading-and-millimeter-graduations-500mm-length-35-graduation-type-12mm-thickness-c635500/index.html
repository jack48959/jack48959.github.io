It features a satin chrome finish. Graduations at mm and 1/2mm on both sides.
Dual Metric System - The Starrett Steel Rule is available in both English and Metric graduations for better performance and user convenience, as both systems are provided on a single rule.
Wide Variation of Sizes - The Starrett rule is the basic measuring tool from which many other tools have been developed. It is offered in multiple sizes, from as small as a one-quarter inch to as much as twelve feet in length for large work.
Accuracy You Can Count On - Starrett precision measuring tools exceed accuracy and performance requirements of national and international standards, providing excellent fine precision tools for industrial, professional and consumer markets worldwide.
The Standard for Excellence - Manufacturing quality tools that provide consistent and reliable performance since 1880, Starrett&rsquo;s commitment to product excellence, has earned them a reputation as one of the most trusted names in the industry.</p><p>This Starrett spring-tempered stainless steel rule has photo-engraved graduations in millimeters and a satin-chrome finish for measuring in woodworking, carpentry, and machining applications. Its graduations are in millimeters and half millimeters on both sides. They are photo engraved for accuracy and staggered in a height pattern for readability. The spring-tempered stainless steel body construction is fully flexible for durability and flexibility. The satin chrome finish aids readability and provides rust resistance.
Rules are devices used to measure distances, or to rule straight lines. Rules have markings at specified intervals (also called graduations), as opposed to straight edges, which lack graduations and are used solely to draw a straight line. Nearly all rules are straight edges, except for rounded rules used to measure circles and arcs of angles in geometry applications. Rules can vary from high-quality steel instruments used by machinists; to retractable rules (also called tape measures) used in carpentry and for home-use; to simple wooden or plastic rules used in primary and secondary schools.
The L.S. Starrett Company manufactures precision measuring tools, metrology and testing equipment, and saw blade products. The company, founded in 1880, is headquartered in Athol, MA.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GPcxYa9sL._SL1250_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
