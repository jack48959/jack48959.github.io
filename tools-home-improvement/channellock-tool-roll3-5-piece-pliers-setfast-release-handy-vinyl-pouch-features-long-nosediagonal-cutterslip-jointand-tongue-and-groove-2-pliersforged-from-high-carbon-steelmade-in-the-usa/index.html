Five-piece set of Channellock&rsquo;s most popular tools (

).
Channellock puts together its most popular tools to create the perfect gift for people that know what real work is all about. This five-piece set includes the 9-1/2-inch 420 and 10-inch 430 tongue and groove pliers, 8-inch 3017 long nose plier, 7-inch 337 side cutter plier, and 6-inch 526 slip joint plier. It also comes with a tool roll with individual sleeves for each tool.
Channellock&rsquo;s tongue and groove pliers are built to last with a PermaLock fastener to eliminate nut and bolt failure, patented reinforcing edge to minimize stress breakage and right angle, laser heat-treated teeth to provide a better, longer lasting grip. The straight jaws provide maximum versatility for a number of different applications, and the unique undercut channels provide a stronger more secure grip, that won&rsquo;t slip on the job.
The 526 plier is built to last with a PermaLock fastener, a wire cutting shear, and a classic and versatile slip joint design. The 3017 long nose plier features a crosshatch teeth pattern for an excellent grip, while the 337 side cutter plier has laser heat-treated cutting edges for long lasting durability and knife-and-anvil cutters that ensure proper cutting edge alignment.
Channellock uses high carbon C1080 steel for superior performance on the job, and an electronic coating for ultimate rust prevention. All tools in this set feature Channellock&rsquo;s iconic blue handle, which is both comfortable in your hand and easy to spot in your tool bag.
