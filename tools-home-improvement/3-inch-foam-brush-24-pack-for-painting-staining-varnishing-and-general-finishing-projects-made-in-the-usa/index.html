That’s a question people ask themselves all the time. The simple answer is you should use both. While using bristle brushes for larger areas and using foam brushes for cut-ins is a common use, foam brushes can be used for quite a few applications throughout the home, shop or workplace.
Foam brushes produce a smooth, brush-stroke-free appearance to your project when finished. A smooth appearance is desirable for many different projects like when working on furniture, cabinetry, trim, model work, metal work, indoor applications, outdoor applications and a whole lot more. Not recommended for use with shellac or lacquer applications.
If you’re a woodworker or have worked with wood projects, then you already know the value of having foam brushes on hand. Staining and varnishing wood is a fantastic way to use foam brushes. Simply dip the brush into the prepared stain and apply in even strokes or drizzle a little stain on the wood and quickly spread it in long, even strokes. A rag can be used to wipe off excess stain, or you can flip the brush over to remove excess stain.
These brushes are also ideal for home painting projects where the appearance of brush strokes are not a desired finished look. They will work with latex and oil based paints and typically apply paint with fewer strokes saving you time. Each brush attached to a wooden dowel style handle and is lightweight for les hand fatigue when working on larger projects.
These foam brushes have a chiseled profile to make getting into tight spaces much easier than standard bristle brushes. This also makes foam brushes ideal for touch up work on walls, baseboards and corners. This foam brush profile also works great for working on models and smaller projects where precision is needed. These brushes are proudly MADE IN THE USA and hold their rigidity better than most brands that are made overseas.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91V3lEEKkCL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
