Your household and guests will appreciate the added stability, especially older adults. Our carpet stair treads provide comfort on wood, tile, stone and other hard stair surfaces and help to protect them from damage. They also help soften noise throughout your home, which is ideal for lively children, dogs and other pets. Do Carpet Stair Treads Attach to Steps? Our skid-resistant carpet stair treads are placed directly onto your steps. The non-slip rubber backing helps to keep the treads in place and creates a safer walking space for your family, guests and pets. These skid-resistant stair treads do not attach to your steps. For added security, you can purchase double-sided carpet tape or carpet tacks separately. We also offer these carpet stair treads with an attachable backing! Are Carpet Stair Treads Pet Friendly? Your pets will appreciate the security of new House Home & More carpet stair treads as much as you do! Walking up and down hard stair surfaces can be a fearful challenge for new puppies, senior dogsand aging cats. The soft surface of carpet stair treads will keep their paws cozy while the added traction helps to prevent slipping, allowing them to move with confidence. Our carpet stair treads provide stability and help to create a safer environment for your entire household, including your pets. If you have pets, consider a carpet color or design that wonât showcase their shedding. How to Care for Your Carpet Stair Treads: Polyester is a naturally stain-resistant material, but when your skid-resistant Diamond Trellis treads need cleaning, we recommend vacuuming with a handheld vacuum or hose attachment to remove surface dirt. If using a full-size vacuum, be sure not to go over the edges, as it will lift the tread from the step or floor. These treads are machine washable, but should be air-dried only. You can also spot clean areas that need extra care with mild soap and water. Before using any carpet cleaning product, test the product on an unnoticeable area to make sure it does not damage or fade your carpet.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81tKXB8kH5L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
