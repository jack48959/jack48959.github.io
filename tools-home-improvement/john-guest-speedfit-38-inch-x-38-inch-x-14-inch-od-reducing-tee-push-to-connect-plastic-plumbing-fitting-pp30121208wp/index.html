From the Manufacturer
Push-fit plastic fitting for the connection of plastic, copper, and CPVC pipe. Designed, manufactured and assembled by John Guest Speedfit. Simply push the fitting fully onto the pipe and twist the plastic nut clockwise to lock in place. Should the need arise to demount the connection unlock the nut and push the collet towards the body of the fitting and pull the pipe to release. The fitting ensures an easier working environment in confined places, is approved for behind the wall installations, and removes the need for hot works on site. Installation can be reduced by around 40-Percent when compared to traditional fixing methods.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41RSBHRcEqL._AC_SL1001_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
