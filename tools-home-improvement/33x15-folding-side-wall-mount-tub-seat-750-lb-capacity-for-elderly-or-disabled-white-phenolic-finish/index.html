From the Manufacturer
Most of us want to remain at home for as long as possible as we age. However, as we mature, slipping and falling while bathing and showering can be a common occurrence. Installing a bath tub seat and grab bars provides security and allows elderly and physically disabled people to remain independent in the privacy of their bathroom. Even if not disabled, you&rsquo;ll find that using a folding bathtub seat is much safer - and easier - when shaving your legs.The water-resistant phenolic bath seat is sanitary, durable and easy to clean. It folds up against the wall when not in use. The folding bathtub seat raises and lowers effortlessly with less than five pounds of pressure and complies with all ADA bathroom requirements. Snug hinges make sure the folding bath tub seat stays in place both in the raised and lowered positions.When correctly installed, this shower seat supports more than 250 pounds and is designed to be maintenance free.The base of this high-quality bath seat is constructed of heavy-duty, rust-resistant 304 stainless steel tubing. The completely waterproof seat base is made up of four heavy-duty, 1/2" thick white phenolic slats which are bolted to the frame and provide excellent drainage. Bathtub seat is installed using two 3" heavy-gauge stainless steel flanges, which are included.The bathtub seat measures 33" long by 15" deep.CSI Bathware offers the finest-quality, commercial-grade ADA bathroom shower seats at manufacturer-direct prices.
