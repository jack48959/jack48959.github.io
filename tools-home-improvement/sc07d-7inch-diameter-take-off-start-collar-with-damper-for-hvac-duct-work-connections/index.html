Speedi-Collar is the innovative energy efficient and time saving Start Collar alternative you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. This revolutionary start-collar features an adhesive gasket that attaches to duct board or metal trunk lines. The patented Quick-Zips tighten to create a virtually air tight seal. Therefore there are no added sealants that are required unlike a standard start-collar. The patented Quick-Zip mounting reduces installation time from 10 mins plus down to a minute or less. And if you pre-attach the flex duct, you can be out of the attic or crawl space in minutes, not hours. The collar was designed with the Quick-Zips located on the outside of the collar flange. You won&rsquo;t have to stick your hand inside a sharp metal collar ever again. There are no sharp tabs to bend back which take time and can cause serious painful injuries. It is the fastest way to connect duct to trunk lines or to the main HVAC unit. It is the &ldquo;One Collar that Fits All&rdquo;. It can be used with 1-Inch, 1.5-Inch and 2-Inch duct board and zips tight or attach to sheet metal trunk lines with screws through the pre-drilled holes on the collar flange. You would need at least four different metal tab collars and have dozens of injury causing tabs to bend back to do the same thing. It can be used for Remodeling, Do it yourself, New Residential/Commercial HVAC projects. This Speedi-Collar comes with a preassembled damper that ratchets in place.
