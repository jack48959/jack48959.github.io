Glazing tape is typically used during the installation process to prevent wind and water from entering by creating the inside seal between the insulated glass panel and the window sash/box. Other uses include mounting of emblems, nameplates, plastic strips and mirrors.
The foam used for JVCC DC-WGT-01 Window Glazing Tape is a high performance closed cell cross-linked polyethylene which is coated on both sides with a high-performance solvent-based acrylic adhesive. The adhesive system is formulated to bond with glass, wood, and aluminum substrates with quick stick, high peel adhesion, and very good strength. Glazing tape is a cleaner and more convenient option over glazing putty and other messy or more difficult to apply products.
JVCC DC-WGT-01 double-sided window glazing tape has outstanding resistance to weather needed for outdoor applications. It has a superior seal against dust and moisture due to its flexible, soft foam. The easy-peel poly liner allows for continuous and complete liner removal during window glazing applications (creating the seal between the insulated glass panel and window sash which helps prevent air and water leakage).
Standards Met: Carrier/Backing: closed cell cross-linked polyethylene foam. Adhesive: solvent-based acrylic. Release Liner: blue polyolefin film. Thickness: 4 mils (liner). Service/Operating Temperature: -22F to 212F. Peel Adhesion (1/16-inch thick): 73 ounces per inch. Peel Adhesion (1/8-inch thick): 46 ounces per inch. Density (1/16-inch thick): 4 pounds per cubic foot. Density (1/8-inch thick): 2 pounds per cubic foot. Core: 3-inch diameter.</p><p>JVCC DC-WGT-01 Window Glazing Tape
