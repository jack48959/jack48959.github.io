The blade is made from AISI 420 corrosion resistant stainless steel and hardened and tempered to HRC 57. This is the same steel used in many of Mikov’s kitchen knives and is designed to take and hold a keen edge and resist corrosion.
The blade is 5-7/8 inches long, 1/2 inch wide and 0.060 inch thick. The blade has a dual-bevel spear point tip. The tip is ground to 55 degrees with a 25-degree angle grind on both bevels. The bevels are precision ground on CNC machines. The laser cut finger indents are useful for applying pressure closer to the tip.
The dual bevel will mark distinct lines equally well on both the right and left side of a part or guide. It will leave crisp lines marking with and against the grain and on end grain. The knife may require just a light stropping to remove a small wire edge to get it razor sharp and ready to use.
The knife can be used either unhandled or wood scales can be attached to make a handle. If a handle is desired the kit comes with 2 brass pins to affix the scales to the blade.</p><p>A marking knife is an invaluable tool that should be in the toolbox of every woodworker.
