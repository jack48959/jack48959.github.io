The Wera 848/851/867/19 Rapidaptor 19-piece bit set expands the functionality of power tools with DIN 3126-D 6,3 ISO 1173 receivers into twist drills and screwdrivers. The set includes a universal bit holder; one each of twist drill bits in metric sizes 3.0 x 38 mm, 4.0 x 44 mm, 4.2 x 45 mm, 5.0 x 50 mm, 6.0 x 50 mm, and 8.0 x 51 mm; one each of Torx screwdriver bits in sizes T10, T15, T20, T25, T30, and T40; and Phillips screwdriver bits in sizes #1 (two included), #2 (three included), and #3 (one included). The universal bit holder accepts all bits with a 1/4" hexagonal shank and has a locking sleeve that slides forward to eject the bit. All bits are constructed from lacquer-coated steel, except drill bits are uncoated high-speed steel. All have a 1/4" hexagonal shank.
The set comes in a black fabric folding pouch for storage and organization. Pouch measures 4 x 4 x 1-1/2 inches (H x W x D). (H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.)
Drill bits are cutting tools used to make holes in a range of materials using machines such as handheld portable drills, machining centers, and lathes. Drill bits come in a variety of lengths and types, the most common of which is the twist drill bit. The round, twisted shaft of the twist drill bit typically has two cutting edges and flutes. The helical twist of the flutes brings chips up and away from the cutting edges and allows for coolant to reach the cutting edges. Jobber length twist drill bits, the most common length of twist drill bit, offer a good compromise of length and reach to work with the widest range of materials and applications. Mechanic&rsquo;s length twist drill bits (also called maintenance length) are a little shorter than jobber length and less prone to deflection when drilling. Short length twist drill bits (also called stub or screw-machine length) are the shortest and stiffest twist drill bits, helping to reduce the chance of deflection or breakage when drilling. Reduced shank drill bits (also called Silver and Deming drill bits) have a shank that is smaller in diameter than its shaft, permitting drilling machines with either a 1/2" or 3/4" drill chuck to create large holes. Long length twist drill bits (also called taper length) are a little longer than jobber length, allowing for deeper holes and longer reach. Extra long twist drill bits (also called extension) are longer than long length twist drill bits for greater reach or for drilling deeper holes.
Screwdriver bits are interchangeable screwdriver blades that attach to the tip of a tool to provide a streamlined alternative to a full screwdriver set. Insert bits have a standardized shank that can be used with a hand drive for screwdriving by hand, or can be placed in an adapter and used with a power tool for fastening. Power bits have a long, grooved shank that inserts directly into a power tool without the use of an adapter and locks for a secure hold.
Wera Tools manufactures screwdrivers and accessories. The company, founded in 1936, is headquartered in Germany and has a U.S. office in Tucker, GA. The company meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001.
