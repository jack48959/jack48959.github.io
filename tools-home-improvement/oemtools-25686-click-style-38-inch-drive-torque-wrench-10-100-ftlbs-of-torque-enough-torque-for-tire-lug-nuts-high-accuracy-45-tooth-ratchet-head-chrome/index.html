The OEMTOOLS 3/8” Drive Click Style Torque Wrench is used to exert an exact amount of torque on a nut, bolt, or screw. These torque wrenches feature a range of 10-100 ft-lbs and a precision torque control 45 tooth ratchet head. The wide torque range allows this adjustable torque wrench to be used as a low range torque wrench, as well as a high range torque wrench. This compact torque wrench offers enough torque to serve as a great torque wrench for motorcycles and cars and can be used as a truck torque wrench as well. The 3/8” drive ratchet can handle uncontrolled wrenching, as long as torque does not exceed maximum capacity. The lock feature and high accuracy aid in preventing over torqueing, allowing for proper tightening of your fasteners. You’ll hear an audible clicking sound when your desired torque is reached. Our flexible torque wrench also features both clockwise and counter-clockwise operation, and a high-grade spring steel torque mechanism. This sturdy torque adapter is designed for professional auto mechanics and heavy-duty applications.
