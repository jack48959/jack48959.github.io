EASY OPERATION: Detach plugs and air tools from high flow air couplers with ease; Push-to-lock design makes placing plugs into the quick change heavy duty air coupler easy; Our air couplers and fittings make switching between air tools convenient

GENEROUS HIGH FLOW SET: Coupler plug kit comes with 10 high flow air fitting M-style plugs and 4 hose couplers; Air hose connector fittings are a standardized 1/4 air hose fittings; Larger interior diameter 1/4 quick connect fittings work at 300 PSI</p><p>Operate your air tools at their maximum PSI with OEMTOOLS 26134 High Flow 14 Piece Coupler & Plug Kit, 1/4" Body, 1/4" NPT. Your standard M-style air hose connectors and air tool connectors won’t give your pneumatic die grinder, paint gun, nail gun, and more the ability to work at their highest capacity. Unlock your tool’s potential with our air compressor quick connect fittings. Their large interior diameter allows for high air flow into your pneumatic tools. This compressor hose connector set comes with male air hose fittings and female fittings like a female quick coupler. Your standard compressor air fittings can leak air, limiting your air quick fittings&rsquo; maximum PSI. Our high flow air coupler and hose plug set work on air compressor hose lines at a maximum of 300 PSI. With our air compressor hose fittings set your pneumatic cut off tool can work smoothly without dips in air flow that can occur with a standard quick air fitting 1/4 NPT coupler and 1/4 NPT plug. Our tight quick connect compressor fittings reduce air compressor connector leaks. The quick connect coupler has a one hand push-to-lock design that makes changing out tools fast and easy. Detaching the tools is as simple as pulling back on the neck of the air hose coupler. Our compressed air hose fittings kit includes (2) High Flow Couplers (1/4" Body, 1/4" FNPT), (2) High Flow Couplers (1/4" Body, 1/4" MNPT), (4) High Flow Plugs (1/4" Body, 1/4" FNPT) and (6) High Flow Plugs (1/4" Body, 1/4" MNPT). Maximize the efficiency and power that your pneumatic tools are capable of with our high flow air hose fittings.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81o06wA6bJL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
