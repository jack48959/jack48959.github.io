This Bemis Classic Colors plastic toilet seat with molded-in color provides a smooth, easy to clean surface with long lasting color. This durable plastic seat resists chips, wears, and stains. It features slow-close technology with the Whisper Close hinge that, with just a tap, allows the lid to close slowly and quietly with no slamming or pinched fingers. With the innovative STAY-TITE Seat Fastening System, the seat does not shift around and stays firmly attached to the toilet bowl. The color-matched Easy Clean & Change hinges allow you to remove the seat for easy cleaning and replacement. This seat is proudly made in Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, USA and fits most manufacturers&rsquo; ROUND bowls in the US and Canada.
