Socket openings on each end and female NPT threads on the branch for connecting three pipes
PVC for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and less weight than fittings made from metal
Operating temperature range of 0 to 60 degrees C (32 to 140 degrees F)
Meets ASTM D1784 and D1785 standards for quality assurance, and meets NSF standards 14 and 61 for potable water service</p><p>This GF Piping Systems schedule 80 PVC tee fitting has socket openings on each end and female NPT threads on the branch, and is suitable for connecting and branching three pipes. The socket ends connect to pipes with a smooth bore for enhanced flow, and the National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads create a tighter seal than straight threads. The fitting is T-shaped and has three openings to connect and branch three pipes, two on the main run and one branch at a 90-degree angle from the middle of the tee. Pipe dimensions for tees are represented as A x B x C. “A” and “B” indicate the main run on the fitting, and “C” indicates the branch. The fitting is made of gray PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and less weight than fittings made from metal. It is compatible with schedule 80 (thick wall) PVC pipes and fittings, and is suitable for chemical processing, industrial plating, chilled water distribution, deionized water lines, and chemical drainage and wastewater treatment systems. PVC can be connected to other materials such as steel, copper, or cast iron using transition fittings. The fitting has an operating temperature range of 0 to 60 degrees C (32 to 140 degrees F), meets ASTM International D1784 and D1785 standards for quality assurance, and meets National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) standards 14 and 61 for potable water service. This schedule 80 PVC tee fitting is suitable for connecting pipes for conveying drinking water, waste water, chemicals, and other liquids in a range of industries.
Pipe fittings are components used for connecting, terminating, controlling flow, and changing the direction of piping in many different industries. When purchasing pipe fittings, consider the application, as this will affect material type, shape, size and required durability. Fittings are available threaded or unthreaded, in many shapes, styles, sizes, and schedules (pipe wall thickness).
GF Piping Systems manufactures piping components and systems for gas and water distribution. The company, founded in 1802 and headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001:2008 and 14001:2004.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xRhv8v2aL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/tools-home-improvement/pvc-pipe-saw-japanese-pull-saw-for-pvc-pe-pipes-plastic-acrylic-plates-blade-replaceable-pvc300-blade/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PVC Pipe Saw, Japanese Pull Saw for PVC & PE Pipes, Plastic & Acrylic Plates, Blade Replaceable (PVC300 Blade)">&larr;
