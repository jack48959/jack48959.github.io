There are four knife sets available for a complete system (sold separately.) Coring doesn&rsquo;t have to be a scary, unnerving experience anymore. Even novice turners with a bit of instruction (instructional video is supplied with the system), can easily remove several bowls from one blank.
Coring will save you time, save your energy, save your tools, save your wood, and can save on a huge amount of clean-up. All these things ultimately save you money! Coring is a very time effective method to make a bowl. You are not only done faster, but it is also less physically demanding and gives you the ability to get several bowls out of one piece. Hollowing out a large bowl can take a large toll on your tools. Coring does require the cutter to be sharpened regularly, but the amount of sharpening required per bowl is drastically reduced.
