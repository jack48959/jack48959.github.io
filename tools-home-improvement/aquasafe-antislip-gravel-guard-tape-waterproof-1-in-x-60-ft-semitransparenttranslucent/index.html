Since the tape is free from harsh abrasives the surface can be easily cleaned, there is no shedding of grit particles, and it will not scrape or wear away fabric, wetsuits, or skin.
The plastic construction (PVC - polyvinyl chloride) along with its texture ensures stability and provides an effective, waterproof non-skid surface. The material is produced by an embossing roller which creates a pattern that only has exposed areas and therefore prevents accumulating trapped dirt. The rubber feel of the tape makes it easy and comfortable to step on with bare feet and is UV resistant.
This tape can also be used as a gravel guard. The thick construction of aqua safe tape provides impact and scratch protection from gravel, stone chips, and other damaging materials to your car, truck, boat, and more. Choose black, white, or translucent to best fit your surface color needs.
Product applications include boats, shower floors, bathtub, barefoot areas, docks and marinas, kitchen, sterile manufacturing, and food prep areas, RV, cars or trucks, and more.

This tape can also be used as a gravel guard. The thick construction of aqua safe tape provides impact and scratch protection from gravel, stone chips, and other damaging materials to your car, truck, boat, and more. The embossed PVC surface will protect all manner of objects from destroying your paintwork and exposing the bare metal underneath, which if not re-painted or treated can lead to rust, excess costs or even worse, an adverse impact on the service life of your vehicle. Bumpers, rocker panels, bonnets, hoods, car doors, trunks, trailers, fuel tanks and all surface areas on vehicles can be protected using Gravel Guard. Choose black, white, or translucent to best fit your surface color needs.
Please note that FindTape Aqua Safe Anti-Slip tape cannot be applied underwater.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r9Bqf93nL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
