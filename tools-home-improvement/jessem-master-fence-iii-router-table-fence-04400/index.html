It is extremely functional while adding that sexy look woodworkers want to have in their shops. 100 Percent Flat Surface We started the design using a red phenolic base for a solid platform but also giving us that 100 percent flat surface every woodworker wants. Black Anodized Finish We precision-machined the 6061 aluminum extrusion and finished the parts with a black anodized finish instead of the plastic high boy knobs seen on all other fences. We went one step further and machined the high boy knobs out of 6061 aluminum. Stainless Steel Hardware The entire fence is constructed using stainless steel hardware and other components to give it that beautiful look that will last a lifetime. To make this fence stand out amongst the rest, we went with maple sub-fences that are cut, machined and laser engraved in the woodshop. Tool Free Adjustment The sub-fence faces can be adjusted tool free with convenient locking knobs on the backside of the fence. The dust port fitting is designed with an inside diameter that accepts a 2-1/4-inch diameter vacuum hose fitting and outside diameter that accepts a 2-1/2-inch vacuum hose fitting. Included with the fence is the unique fence face shimming bars. These bars are laser engraved with one side designed to offset the fence face 1/32-inchand the other 1/16-inch. When not in use they conveniently store on the backside in the shimming bar holder.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bWmBP1BFL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
