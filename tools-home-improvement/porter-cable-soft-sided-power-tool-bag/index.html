ZIPPERED ENCLOSURE: Whatever you manage to stuff in this bag, you can be sure that it’ll be safe with the help of the durable metal zipper running along the top
STRONG, BUT LIGHTWEIGHT: The durable canvas material minimizes the weight that you have to lug around on the job, making this the perfect addition to your compact toolkit
COMPACT: When not in use to store your tools, flashlights, or other accessories, you can keep this bag folded into itself for the maximum storage potential
HANDLES WITH CROSS-X STITCHING: These sturdy handles are reinforced to the bag with the help of a special stitching technique, allowing you to keep this bag stuffed with minimal risk of tearing</p><p>For a portable storage solution, why not go with this Porter Cable bag? It’s compact, lightweight, and sturdy, and that’s about everything you would need from a bag for some power tools, bits, or other accessories. It’s soft-sided and flexible, so when not in use, you can keep it tucked away in your workshop or warehouse without taking up too much space. Conversely, the fabric reduces risk of tearing when the bag is stuffed full of inventory. This support is increased with the help of the metal zipper enclosure running across the bag’s top. Couple that with the cross-x stitching reinforcing the thick handles, and you’ve got a bag that can serve to protect your most valuable assets, or your lunch, with comfort and ease. With Porter Cable, you’re going to have an easier time on the job.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1glfKF0UIL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
