Here are the detailed illustrated step-by-step Damask/Allover Stenciling Tips.And please make sure you watch our short step-by-step
Video Tutorials!You&rsquo;ll find them extremely helpful for your stenciling project. While prior experience is helpful when working with repeat interlocking stencils, even beginners get great results!Most of our stencils do not require the use of spray adhesive, and this design is very forgiving due to its nature. However, if you want to minimize paint seepage or are using high contrasting colors, spray adhesive is very helpful (Elmer&rsquo;s spray adhesive seems to be the best). Make sure you shake the can well and lightly mist (not drench) the stencil, and let it dry for a moment before positioning it on the wall. This step will prevent the adhesive residue transferring to the wall. You&rsquo;ll need to re-mist the stencil after a few repeats. Clean-up tip: Spray the stencil with Simple Green to help to remove adhesive residue.Try this stencil with our new Clip-on Stencil Level, (sold separately) and discover how easy it is to achieve perfectly level results without dealing with all those bulky heavy bubble levels and annoying laser levels.Stenciling on rough or textured walls may contribute to increased paint bleed. For more information on stenciling on textured walls, see our F.A.Q. section.The stencil is made out of durable 12 mil clear plastic stencil material. This material is strong but flexible, reusable and easy to clean. We love it so much more than standard 5-8 mil Mylar! It&rsquo;s not brittle, user friendly and just so easy to work with. In our many years of professional stenciling this material has proven to be far superior in quality to any other stencil material we used. Our customers love it too, and we are sure that you&rsquo;ll notice the difference! Our stencils will last a long time and are a pleasure to use.
