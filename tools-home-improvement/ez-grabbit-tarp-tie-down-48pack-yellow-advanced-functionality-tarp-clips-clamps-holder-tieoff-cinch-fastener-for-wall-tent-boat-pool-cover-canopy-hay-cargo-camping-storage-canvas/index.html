Regardless of weather conditions, including high winds, the patented tech of the EZ Grabbit has holding capability that won’t damage or tear your tarps. It uses a binding technique called linear grappling that has no sharp edges or tarp damaging teeth. The harder you pull the tighter the grip along its smooth gripping edges. Please see its amazing features.
Feature 1: Mount tarps to surfaces - Secure your tarps to rigid surfaces such as trucks, trailers, buildings and other structural surfaces. See trailer image for application example.
Feature 2: Connect tarps together - Only EZ Grabbit allows you to overlap and connect your tarps together. Once connected you can pull the tarps as tight as you can and use the two tarps as one. The overlapping of the tarps also allows for excellent rain flash configurations.
Feature 3: Attach anywhere to tarp - Attach anywhere to your tarp including the same side. This is especially useful when you need to attach in the middle areas on large spans of material. You can make great shelters and protective covers with this capability.
Feature 4: Save and reuse damaged tarps - Many times your tarp is still good but your grommets are torn out. If you&rsquo;ve invested in an expensive canvas tarp or heavy duty poly tarp a torn grommet is not what you want. EZ Grabbit will extend the life of your tarp for additional years.</p><p>The EZ Grabbit:
