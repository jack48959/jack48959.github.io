CAST GRID TEXTURE - Pads are cast with a grid texture that provides your vise with additional grip on secured projects
DUCTILE IRON CONSTRUCTION - Constructed of ductile iron these pads clamp onto your project with a grip stronger than machined aluminum but without the damaging hardness of steel
PERFECT FOR FABRICATION - Ideal for securing metal projects during fabrication as the ductile iron helps to dampen vibrations from drills and grinders
COMPATIBLE SPEEDJAW VISE - Designed to easily slip over the built-in pads on the SPEEDJAW 92746 vise</p><p>Expand the usefulness of your 4-inch vise with the SPEEDJAW 92808 Ductile Iron Vise Pad Set. Made from ductile iron these pads have a cast in grid texture that provides your vise with increased grip on metal objects that regular flat, steel or aluminum vise pads have difficulty holding securely. Designed to slip over the existing jaws of the SPEEDJAW 92746 vise these pads take only a few seconds to install and require no tools to attach. Ideal for holding metal projects during fabrication as the ductile iron helps to dampen the vibrations from a drill or grinder which can often cause vises to slowly loosen when working on a project. Set includes 2 vise pads.
SPEEDJAW Tools are specifically designed to save time and money. With patented features that allow fast adjustability, our precision-made clamping tools and low-profile bench vises are renowned for their strength and durability.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81utOGV4agL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
