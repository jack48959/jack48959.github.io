We decorative pros &ldquo;fudge&rdquo; allover patterns all the time! The walls in most houses are often not straight, so some &ldquo;fudging&rdquo; while stenciling helps a lot.Since it is a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; stencil design, you should start with the lighter background which will become the color of your birch trunks, and apply the darker stenciling color, which will become the space between branches.

The trick with stenciling is to take care not to over-load your roller or brush with paint and not to press hard on a roller while stenciling. I personally prefer just to use blue painter&rsquo;s tape instead of adhesive, but for beginners I would suggest using spray adhesive.Our stencils are made to last and with proper care and storage will serve you for a long time.
