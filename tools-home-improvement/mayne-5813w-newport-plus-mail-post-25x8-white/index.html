From the Manufacturer
Our Newport Plus Mail Post offers a larger stronger mailbox arm able to handle added weight. Package contents include the decorative post, mailbox arm, and the hardware pack to install the arm. Mayne mail posts install easily over a standard 4x4 wood post. Bury about 2-3ft in the ground and leave 4ft above the ground. Slide the decorative sleeve over the post, attach the mailbox arm to the post, and then secure your mailbox of choice to the arm. A mounting plate or bracket is required when mounting mailbox on the Newport Plus.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91zAFR7JUfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
