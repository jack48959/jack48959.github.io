ABOUT SOG
Our story begins in Vietnam, where members of a highly classified US special ops unit - known as MACV-SOG - carried a unique combat knife into the jungle on covert missions.
Years later, in 1986, that knife inspired a young designer, named Spencer Frazer, to found SOG Specialty Knives.
His mission: to reproduce the original SOG Bowie knife and pay tribute to the special ops unit that created it.
What began as a single commemorative model soon became a full line of innovative tools - field-proven by US Special Forces, even honored as the Navy SEAL knife of choice.
Today, SOG knives are carried with confidence into the most demanding situations. Forged out of tradition, hardened in the field, honed for you.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nLvIE1y6L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
