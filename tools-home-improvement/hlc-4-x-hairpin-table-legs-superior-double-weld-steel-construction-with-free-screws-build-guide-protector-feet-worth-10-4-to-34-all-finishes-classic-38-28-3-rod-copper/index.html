Recapture the style and sophistication of the 40s with classic hairpin legs. They&rsquo;re suitable for both rebuilds and new projects by the DIY home-builder and the professional.
Standing Up To The Test Of Time
With the weight of your project riding on our legs (quite literally), we put maximum effort into ensuring that they&rsquo;ll last for a lifetime. All three of our rods are fully welded front and back for maximum strength. Combined with the strongest furniture-grade steel, this makes for a nearly indestructible leg.
Lots of Options
We stock a huge variety of heights, from tiny 4" legs all the way up to 40" counter-top level hairpins. Different styles will provide different amounts of strength, depending on the configuration. So, how much strength do you need? Here are a few rules of thumb:
2-rod legs are suitable for all low projects from cabinets up to coffee tables. They&rsquo;re also suitable for 2-3 person benches and light side tables.
3-rod legs are suitable for heavy side tables and 3+ person benches. They&rsquo;ll also handle work or dining tables up to 130lbs.
We also sell a range of heavy duty legs made from 1/2" steel for desks and dining tables weighing more than 130lbs. Please check our other listings for more details.
Protective Coat
Black and clear powder coats protect your investment, look great, and won&rsquo;t flake off. You can also order your legs unfinished, but please note that raw steel will rust, even indoors. If you&rsquo;re looking for the raw metal look, our clear powder coat is your best bet.
Happiness Guaranteed
We want you to be happy. Worried that these legs aren&rsquo;t quite the right fit for your project? Return them any time within 60 days of your order for a no-questions-asked refund.
