Mikov is currently the largest knife maker in the Czech Republic and has been making knives since 1794.
The blade is made from AISI 420 corrosion resistant stainless steel and hardened and tempered to HRC 57. This is the same steel used in many of Mikovâ€™s kitchen knives and is designed to take and hold a keen edge resist corrosion.
The blade is 1-7/8 inches long, 1/2 inch wide and 0.100 inch thick. The blade has a dual-bevel spear point tip. The tip is ground to 55 degrees with a 25-degree grind on both bevels. The bevels are precision ground on CNC machines.
The dual bevel will mark distinct lines equally well on both the right and left side of a part or guide. It will leave crisp lines marking with and against the grain and on end grain. The knife may require just a light stropping to remove a small wire edge to get it razor sharp and ready to use.
The handle is made from Mexican Rosewood which has been hand sanded and polished. The scales are attached to the blade via two brass pins. The handle makes the perfect size for a nimble yet stout marking knife. The square handle profile prevents the knife from rolling off the bench.</p><p>A marking knife is a tool that should be in the toolbox of every woodworker.
