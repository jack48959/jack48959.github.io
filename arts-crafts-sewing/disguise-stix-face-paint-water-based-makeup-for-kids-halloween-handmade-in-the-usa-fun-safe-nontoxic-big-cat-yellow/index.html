Fun Since 1961:
Graftobian’s earliest product, Disguise Stix, is an American classic. Proudly manufactured in the USA for 3 generations, Disguise Stix are the ultimate face paint. Practical and accessible, our proprietary “make-up on a stick” design allows for easy application to the face, body, or hair directly from the stick. Apply with a sponge for large areas or for stenciling, or with brushes for detail work. Disguise Stix are hypoallergenic, soap based and non-greasy. Simply activate with water and you’re ready to go! Once applied, Disguise Stix face paint is durable, doesn’t cake or crumble, and easily washes off of and out of anything with ordinary bar soap and water. Safe and fun for kids of all ages since 1961!
Say Goodbye to Uncomfortable Halloween Masks:
This Halloween, rather than using a mask that can obstruct vision, use Disguise Stix to make up yourself or your children as the monster, superhero, or other fictional character you desire.
Make Bath Time Fun:
Next time your little is due for a bath, try Disguise Stix. This gentle soap-based product is perfect for bath time play.
Crayon or Watercolor Substitute:
Kids love to color, and Disguise Stix, when dry, are great fun for drawing. Disguise Stix are also a great substitute for watercolors. In fact, many of our colors are bolder and brighter than you may get out of watercolor sets. Both children and adults have created remarkable paintings using Disguise Stix as a medium.
Can Be Stored for Years:
Disguise Stix can be kept for years: once dry, simply store them in the reusable bag they came in.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kcdZlvZEL._SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
