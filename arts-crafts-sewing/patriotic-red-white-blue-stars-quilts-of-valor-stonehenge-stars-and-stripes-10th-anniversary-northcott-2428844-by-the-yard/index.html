As a teen, she rummaged through flea markets and thrift stores looking for vintage textiles and lace, not realizing her passion for textiles would evolve into a life-long career, starting with a degree in textile design from the Ontario College of Art and Design. For more than two decades Deborah worked as VP of Design for an international company designing fabric, bedding, wallcovering and area rugs. She has developed collections for celebrities including Martha Stewart and Jaclyn Smith and has been a member and chair holder of Color Marketing Group for many years. Looking for a new challenge, Deborah welcomed the opportunity to join Northcott as Design Director. &ldquo;In addition to creating my own collections under the Northcott brand, the privilege of collaborating with and supporting designers from various disciplines continues to be an exciting journey&rdquo;. A note about designer, Linda Ludovico: Linda has always had a passion for color and design, which drove her to pursue a career in the arts. After earning a Bachelor of Arts Degree, Linda took graduate courses at FIT in New York. Her career began with the textile design for women and children’s fashion in New York, but soon expanded into international home furnishings.
