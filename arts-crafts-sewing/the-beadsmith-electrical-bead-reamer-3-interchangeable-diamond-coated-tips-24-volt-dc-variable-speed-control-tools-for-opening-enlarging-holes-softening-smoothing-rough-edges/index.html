The files are made from steel and are designed for long lasting performance. The long-pointed reamers are ideal to smooth and enlarge the bead holes. The shorter shaped reamers are ideal to soften rough edges around the bead hole.
PROFESSIONAL GRAIN: The metal file is encrusted with industrial grade diamond great for repeated use. This product is great quality and long lasting. Diamond grade tips are great for precise work because of their extremely fine, sharp, and high-quality tips. They can be used to enlarge small holes to accommodate the hemp, string, wire, or anything you would be using to stick through the bead.
DELUXE SET: This set includes 3 interchangeable diamond grit tips and an electrical tool to house the reamers when in use. To soften round edges and prevent threads from being cut use the 1.75” reamers with the 45-degree edging point. To enlarge bead holes use the longer 2.25” and 3.25” tips. Unscrew the housing to store the diamond points, keeping them in a safe place in an organized way.
FLAWLESS FINISH: Use to grind bead holes larger, remove unwanted burrs from bead holes before stringing and smooth and file rough edges. This set can use for smoothing, refining, reshaping projects. They are perfect for shaping plastic, wood, metal, jewelry, ceramic, stone, shell, pearl, gemstone, and glass beads. These bead reamers will ensure precise work for all your beading needs.

Our experts are here to help. Your satisfaction is important to us. Contact us with any quality issues or concerns.</p><p>Often a hole in a bead, pearl, shell, or gem is too small, is not straight, or the two holes in some hand-drilled beads may not quite meet. The Beadsmith has a solution! The diamond tipped bead reamers are the perfect tool to quickly solves all those problems. This three-piece kit has all the shapes and widths you&rsquo;ll ever need. With a compact, lightweight handle, these steel tools encrusted with industrial grade diamond are used to grind bead holes larger and take out unwanted burrs from bead holes before stringing. To use, select the reamer you want. While pressing the round black button, slowly turn the collet counterclockwise to allow the chuck to open wide enough to insert the reamer bit. Continue holding the button and insert the bit into place. Dip the bead and the end of the reamer tip in water. This will act as a lubricant, as reaming with dry tips will cause excessive wear of their diamond coating. Plug in the unit and rotate the power dial towards the ON position. Once it clicks, it is on, and the speed will increase the more the dial is turned. Now you’re ready to being! Remember to use a bead holder to hold the bead and to always keep the end of the tip and the bead wet. This easy-to-use kit includes 2 tips to enlarge holes, and 1 triangular tip to smooth. This set is perfect for smoothing, refining, and reshaping many materials including, wood, plastic, metal, jewelry, glass, ceramic, stone, shell, pearl, gemstone, and glass beads. The fine diamond grade tip allows for sharp, precise work that will leave you with a flawless finish. Repair or create jewelry for family and friends, create gifts for birthdays and holidays or give this reamer set as a present for your artistic loved ones!</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Fydp0PjzL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
