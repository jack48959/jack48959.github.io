PRAYER ON THE BACK: Saint Therese promised that she would shower roses from Heaven after her death. She also promised that those who prayed to her would always receive an answer. Her intercessory prayer is considered by many devout Catholics to be very powerful for this reason. Often people will pray this Prayer for a period of nine days to make their request
10 PACK</p><p>On October 1, Catholics around the world honor the life of St. Thérèse of the Child Jesus, or St. Thérèse of Lisieux on her feast day. Though her life she performed little acts of charity always, and little sacrifices not caring how unimportant they seemed. These acts helped her come to a deeper understanding of her vocation. Since her death, millions have been inspired by her ‘little way’ of loving God and neighbor. Many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. She had predicted during her earthly life that “My Heaven will be spent doing good on Earth.” Saint Thérèse was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope John Paul II in 1997 - 100 years after her death at the age of 24. She is only the third woman to be so proclaimed, after Saint Catherine of Siena and Saint Teresa of Avila. PRAYER TO ST THERESE: Saint Therese of the Child Jesus, the Little Flower, please pick me a Rose from the heavenly garden and send it to me with a message of love. O Little Flower of Jesus, ask God today to grant the favor I now implore, and tell Him I will love Him each day more and more! Saint Therese, help me to always believe as you did, in God’s great love for me, so that I might imitate your “Little Way” each day. Amen.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714-c-hp3aL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/arts-crafts-sewing/stabilo-8052-all-coloured-pencil-crayons-for-almost-all-surfaces-33-mm-white-pack-of-24/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stabilo 8052 All Coloured Pencil Crayons for Almost All Surfaces, 3.3 mm, white, Pack of 24">&larr;
