Start your stencil collection today and add some charm to your home; similarly our stencils will help inspire the artist in you, and soon you will discover the joy that comes from creating something beautiful with your own hands</p><p>Inspire the artist in you with this precision laser-cut quality 7 mil Mylar sign stencil that allows you to use your favorite medium on most flat surfaces. 7 mil Mylar is the industry standard for medium-weight sheeting that will produce clean and crisp edges every time, when used properly. Stenciling is a “dry brush” technique. If paint seeps underneath your stencil, it is not the material - it is an indication that the applicator has too much paint. 7 mil Mylar is not a thick plastic template and not recommended for tracing with markers, engraving, sand-blasting, wood burning or embossing. The stencil can be traced with a fine lead pencil if you desire an outline image first and then fill in with paints, cremes or markers. Express your personal style and paint a sign, decorate hand-made cards, stencil a t-shirt for a friend, give new purpose to inexpensive items (glass, wood, bags, canvas, fabric, furniture). When you purchase this stencil, we can work together and create something beautiful for your home today.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SEyOF0vQL._AC_SL1256_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
