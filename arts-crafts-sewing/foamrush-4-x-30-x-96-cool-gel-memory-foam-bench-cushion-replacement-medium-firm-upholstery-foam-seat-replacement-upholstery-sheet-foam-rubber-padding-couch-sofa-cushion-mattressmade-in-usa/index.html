All of our foam is certified as being safe and better and for the environment when compared to non-certified or non-regulated foam. We also provide foam products that are cut-to-order to ensure the best quality for our customers. Locally made
Use For a Variety of Projects: Foam is not just for sofas and chairs! It can be customized to repair worn down chairs, create custom cushions for patio chairs and benches, ottomans, stools, headboards, RVs, boat seats, car seats, golf cart seats, workout benches, cots, window seats, restore vintage furniture, foam mattress toppers and carrying cases for delicate glass or ceramic items, packing foam for delicate glass or ceramic items, accent pillows and many other crafts and DIY projects
Easy to Customize: Our foam is easy to slice through with tools such as a sharp knife, serrated knife, electric knife, or electric hot wire foam cutter. You can trim the edges or stack layers for extra thickness to customize our foam in a way that perfectly meets your needs. Foam can also be glued together to create wider pieces or layered upon one another to create thicker cushions. Foamrush foam can be cut and customized to whatever size or shape you need.
Foam Care Instructions: Open your package immediately. Please use caution and do not use anything sharp to open your shipping box as you may cut through and tear into the foam. Remove your foam from the shipping box and unroll it so that it may relax. Allow up to 3 to 4 days for the foam to fully expand to its original size as your foam has been rolled into a bundle and compressed for shipping. Please cut your foam until you have followed these product care instructions</p><p>Cool gel infused memory foam disperse body heat and create a cooler surface while retaining the pressure-relieving properties of traditional memory foam. In addition to the slow, conforming response, gel memory foam offers complete, luxurious and stress-free support. Dual layers gel infused, ventilated memory foam surface + high density foam base for excellent support for a medium feel. High density foam has a compression rate of 44lbs. It features the perfect amount of cushioning and stiffness. Its soft but still holds its firmness and support for an individual to sit on it without compressing the foam too much. Compression = firmness compression (not density) is what determines firmness. If you don’t want a cushion that’s hard as a rock or a mattress that sinks when you sit on it, you have to check the compression or ild number. Do not open with a box cutter. Use a ball point pen or a pencil. Start by making a little incision and break it from there - durability : will last 7 to 10 years. It has high quality compression and material to keep it lasting for longer periods of time even when harsh weight is applied. 50% restocking fee may apply.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51GTrkHdv1L._AC_SL1080_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
