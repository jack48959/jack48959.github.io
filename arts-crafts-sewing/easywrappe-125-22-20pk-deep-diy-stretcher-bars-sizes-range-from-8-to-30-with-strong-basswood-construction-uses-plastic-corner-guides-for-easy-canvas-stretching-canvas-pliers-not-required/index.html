EASYWRAPPE 1.25” SUPPORTS your small eight-inch photo prints as well as the large two-and-a-half-foot shots of snails on lettuce
NO NEED TO TREK TO A HARDWARE STORE because you missed buying a tool. This gallery wrap system needs no stretching pliers or special tools
WHEN SPEED AND EASE OF USE is of the essence, this DIY stretching system makes quick work of the loose canvas you have sitting around
FIRST TIME USING EasyWrappe? Make sure to purchase the 1.25” EasyWrappe Starter Kit so that you have everything you need to get stretching</p><p>You have been listing your artwork for sale. Finally! You found a buyer. However, this buyer does not want a loose canvas shipped that they then have to take to the frame store for stretching. No, this buyer is willing to meet your price point if you send it as a gallery wrap item. With the EasyWrappe 1.25", you can do precisely that.
There used to be a time when the frame shop made good money every time you set foot inside the venue. You brought your art, they spent a few minutes transforming it into a wrap, and you parted with your hard-earned money. Now is the time to cut out the intermediary and do the process yourself.
When you have art pieces that measure between eight inches and 30 inches, the carefully constructed basswood is the ideal medium to work with. It is a durable wood that is forgiving of clumsy first attempts at canvas stretching. Of course, it works perfectly well for the pro who can do the process in their sleep.
Because you do not need a stretching tool to create your gallery wraps, this process is available right out of a box. (Hint: If you needed another reason why the EasyWrappe 1.25" is an excellent gift for the artist on your list, here it is!)
This product is so user-friendly that you can be a complete newbie at all things having to do with gallery wraps and still pull off a professional-looking product at the end of the day. Just remember that we recommend a two-inch border even though the system accommodates one-and-a-half-inches all the way around. Do it our way first; you can always customize the display setup later if you find a better option.
By the way, make sure you have plastic corner clamps and archival glue ready to go.
