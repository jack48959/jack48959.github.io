Its soft but still holds its firmness and support for an individual to sit on it without compressing the foam too much. Compression = firmness compression (not density) is what determines firmness. If you dont want a cushion thats hard as a rock or a mattress that sinks when you sit on it, you have to check the compression or ild number. Compression means the number of pounds necessary to compress a piece of foam 25% and still bounce back to the original thickness. For example, a 4" thick piece of foam that requires 33 lbs. To pack it down 1" and have it return to its full 4" thickness has a 33 lb. Compression rating or (ild) -indention load deflection. Do not open with a box cutter. Use a ball point pen or a pencil.
