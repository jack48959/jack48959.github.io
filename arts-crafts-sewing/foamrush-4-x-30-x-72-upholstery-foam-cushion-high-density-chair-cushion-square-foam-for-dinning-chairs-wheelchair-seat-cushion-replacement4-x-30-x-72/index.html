Its soft but still holds its firmness and support for an individual to sit on it without compressing the foam too much. Compression is firmness compression (not density) is what determines firmness. If you dont want a cushion thats hard as a rock or a mattress that sinks when you sit on it, you have to check the compression or ild number. Compression means the number of pounds necessary to compress a piece of foam 25% and still bounce back to the original thickness. For example, a 4" thick piece of foam that requires 33 lbs. To pack it down 1" and have it return to its full 4" thickness has a 33 lb. Compression rating or (ild) -indention load deflection. - all foam sheets are sold per sheet - not per yard.
