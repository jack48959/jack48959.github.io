These blood-curdling creatures are sure to terrify any trick-or-treaters, coworkers, or customers. This witch&rsquo;s eyes light up with evil intentions while her creepy sounds give warning she is near. She crawls across the floor, bringing haunting scares from room to room. Her wretched green face and wide open mouth are unforgettable to any poor soul who sees them. Sharp bony fingers protrude from her black dress and bushy gray hair spills down her shoulders. Her cobweb cloak keeps her warm as she moves through the night, searching for unsuspecting visitors. She is battery operated for convenient placement virtually anywhere you need a spooky accent. Place her on the front porch to greet visitors or in your living room to complement the rest of your spooky decor. For longer prop life, we recommend indoor or sheltered outdoor use protected from inclement weather. For thrills and chills so frightening that your neighbors will run shrieking in horrendous delight, count on Halloween decorations from Haunted Hill Farm.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IP1qnfTIL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
