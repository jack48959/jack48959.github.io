TRIPLE WALL CONSTRUCTION – It is constructed from 10 gauge 100% Made In The USA steel (up to 30% more durable against foreign competitors) with an extra 20” of steel encasement around the handle, which is made from a high quality and coated fiberglass, and a 24″ reinforcing wood core to increase the shovel strength even more
DESIGNED TO PERFECTION – The steel teeth on the head of the track shovel make digging through solid mud and debris an ease, and the extra thick 10 gauge steel of the head makes this tool nearly indestructible throughout the toughest jobs; nearly two quarters thick compared to competitors that are only a penny thick!
D-shaped polypropylene grip with a no-slip texture, designed to increase leverage and reduce hand fatigue, while wide enough to accommodate work gloves
100% Made In The USA</p><p>Tired of handles breaking when used to pry hardened mud, or the steel head gives way? That happens because your only option was using a gardener’s drain spade that was never intended for cleaning tracks on heavy equipment, until now! The Bully Tools 10 Gauge Excavator / Track Shovel has been designed and tested with that extensive abuse in mind, for it is made from a triple layer construction consisting of 10 gauge 100% Made In The USA steel (up to 30% more durable against foreign competitors) with an extra 20” of steel encasement around the handle, which is made from a high quality and coated fiberglass, and a 24″ reinforcing wood core to increase the shovel strength even more. This bulldozer track shovel was designed after consulting operators that actually clean out tracks daily for a living. We had this product tested in the field, and the results were unanimously positive! It is by far the best tool to clean tracks and will outlast any five drain spades; you are more likely to accidentally lose this tool before it wears out!</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IXGd8pHEL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
