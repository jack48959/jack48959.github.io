This quilted hammock is designed to offer both a relaxing experience and a pop of color and style to any space. Quilted hammocks are known to be the easiest to get into while also providing the most stability!
✅ FOLD AND GO: Who says the experience of constant relaxation is limited to your backyard? Simply fold the hammock up and go! The quilted hammock can easily be brought along anywhere your adventure may take you.
✅ WEATHER-RESISTANT FABRIC: Lay back and experience the comfort of the plush quilted hammock bed which is constructed of a comfortable yet weather-resistant polyester fabric. The polyester fabric is padded with breathable polyfiber filling to provide extra comfort for extended laying and naps.
✅ DURABLE SPREADER BAR: Unlike brazilian style fabric hammocks, this quilted hammock with hardwood spreader bars keeps the hammock bed spread out for you to experience true relaxation without being wrapped in fabric! Each hardwood spreader bar is sanded and varnished to reveal the wood’s natural beauty while withstanding the elements.
✅ EASY TO USE: This double quilted hammock is spacious enough to accommodate two people with an 350 pound weight capacity! Simply remove the quilted hammock from the storage bag and hang it with the two s-hooks and 1.5 ft. extension chains that are included.
✅ AMERICAN BASED BRAND: All Castaway Living products are designed and tested for quality assurance in the USA. Castaway Living provides USA based customer support and backs all products for up to one year after the purchase date to be free of defects in workmanship and materials.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w1FMZhEXL._AC_SL1080_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
