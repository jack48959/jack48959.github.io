USE TO WATER A VARIETY OF AREAS: Ideal for watering groundcover, decorative grasses, flower and vegetable gardens, as well as trees and shrubs
HOW TO INSTALL: Adjustable Flow Bubbler Assembly comes preassembled so it’s ready to install—insert the stake in the ground and connect the attached 1/4 in. tubing to larger size supply tubing with the Clamp N Pierce Connector
KEY FEATURES: Adjustable flow bubbler, 1/4 in. Clamp N Pierce inlet, and 13 in. stake come preassembled for a quicker install; Stream spray bubbler releases water in a full-circle pattern; Patented Clamp N Pierce Connector punches a hole into supply tubing and attaches 1/4 in. tubing inlet
SPECIFICATIONS: Discharge rates from 0 to 13 GPH, radius from 0 to 3.0 ft. (at 15-50 PSI); full-circle pattern; Adjustable flow bubbler and 1/4 in. tubing made of polyethylene treated with UV inhibitors to prevent fading and cracking; Stake and Clamp N Pierce Connector are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) treated with UV inhibitors to prevent fading and cracking</p><p>The ease of setting up a drip irrigation system is made even easier with the Adjustable Flow Bubbler Assembly. It comes preassembled and ready to install onto tubing. The patented Clamp N Pierce inlet snaps into supply tubing by hand, no tools needed. The 8-stream bubbler emits water in a full-circle pattern at up to 13 GPH and radius of 3 ft. (at 15-50 PSI). Use the dial to control amount of output. Bubbler and tubing are made of polyethylene; stake and connector are made of ABS; all materials are treated with UV inhibitors. Drip irrigation systems are easy to customize, install, and operate. With a non-pressure compensating emitter, expect varying water flows based on length of tubing or elevation, with higher flows closer to the water source. The Bubbler Assembly comes preassembled with bubbler, stake, and Clamp N Pierce inlet; ideal for groundcover, flower and vegetable gardens, trees and shrubs. Raindrip offers an emitter for every watering need. Raindrip is a leading manufacturer of drip and micro-irrigation solutions and the trusted brand of landscapers since 1972.
