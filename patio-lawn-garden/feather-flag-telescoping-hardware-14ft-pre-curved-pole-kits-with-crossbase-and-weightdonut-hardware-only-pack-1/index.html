HEAVY DUTY aluminium flag pole with steel cross-base. Compare our cross-bases to the competitors. You&rsquo;ll notice that ours are NOT just two pieces of light-weight hollow pipes bent and screwed together. We use heavy duty SOLID plates to create our bases. A reusable weight-donut is also included and it can be filled with sand or water.

MADE FOR 11.5 to 12ft WINDLESS FEATHER FLAGS: These poles will not work on smaller or larger flags. They are intended for us with the standard stock swooper flags that are 2.5ft wide
MADE FOR 11.5 to 12ft SWOOPER FLAGS: These poles will not work on smaller or larger flags. They are intended for use with the standard stock swooper flags that are 2.5ft wide. These pole kits will not work on flags of other styles, shapes, or sizes.</p><p>Aluminum Pole Kit for feather flags.The Aluminum Pole Kit for Feather Flags is made of 100% pure aluminum and has no recycled aluminum unlike competitors. This pole set has three straight pole pieces with a top pre-curved pole to fit our flags.
This pole set is a stronger pole set compared to the fiberglass poles and is more durable in windy weather. This pole set can be used for our stock feather flags, and custom feather flags in either single or double-sided forms.
Cross base is perfect for any flat surface. This can be used indoors or outdoors. The base itself is about 10 pounds and can be used with our weight donut that can be filled with water or sand for an additional 30 pounds. You can also use sandbags to add extra support. The cross base can be used with any of our poles.
What your package will include:
⚫️Cross-Base Water Bag (weight-donut) is made to fit over our x-stands or flat bases. The bladder will not come pre-filled with water or sand. This Water bag will help keep your pole set with x-stand in place. Perfect for any outdoor shows or markets. Simply fill this weight-donut and place it on top of the x-stand. Two of these can be stacked on top of each either for extra weighted support. We highly recommend using multiple donuts for areas with high winds or gusts. This bag can be easily filled with water or sand.
⚫️There is no industry standard for flags and poles. That means there is no guarantee that our poles will fit another company’s flags or vice versa. Our pole kit is about 1.15″ in diameter. The sleeves on our flags is about 2″ inches wide.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wFndLgTqL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
