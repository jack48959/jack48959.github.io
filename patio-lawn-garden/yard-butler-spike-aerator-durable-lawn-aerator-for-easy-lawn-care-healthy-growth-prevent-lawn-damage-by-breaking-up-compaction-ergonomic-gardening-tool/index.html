From the Manufacturer
Is Your Lawn Gasping For Air?The Yard Butler Spike Aerator has sharp spikes that slip into the ground to loosen the soil, and a smooth, strong &ldquo;powder coated&rdquo; resin finish that resists rusting . Old lawns and lawns where a lot of activity takes place become compacted. Also thatch from dead leaves builds up creating a barrier, keeping water and air from reaching the roots. The symptoms are thin turf with poor color and bare patches that don&rsquo;t respond to watering and fertilizer.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91IR-fP5gML._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
