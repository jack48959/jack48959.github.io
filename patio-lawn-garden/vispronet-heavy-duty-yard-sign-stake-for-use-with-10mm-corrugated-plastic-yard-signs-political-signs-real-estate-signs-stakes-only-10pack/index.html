These kinds of stakes are popular to use with yard letters. It is recommended that these beefy stakes are used every 12in of a sign. These stakes can be outside for a while due to their long-lasting 9-gauge titanium construction. They are also long, but lightweight so that they can be used with signs of all shapes and sizes. Keep your political and real estate yard signs and yard letters taut and secure with this bundle of 10 stakes.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51mq8HOZqkL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
