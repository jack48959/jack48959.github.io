12in Metal Prescott Planter, Tansy Green
From the Manufacturer
The wonder of glazed IronStone. Glazed IronStone, its strong, It&rsquo;s resilient. It has the character of pottery with the strength of metal. A material that makes planters perfect for an outdoor porch, picnic area, near a fireplace indoors, or just about anywhere you can think of. Though the benefits go on and on, the difference of Glazed IronStone starts with its durability. When a car door is stamped out, some metal is left over. Rather than going to waste, this metal is molded, spun on a lathe, and transformed into a planter. The result is remarkably seamless in shape and form, giving the planter a refined and sophisticated look. Once stamped, molded and made seamless the planter gets three powder coats of high-quality paint. After each individual layer, the planter is baked, ensuring vibrant and long-lasting color. At this point, you&rsquo;d think the planter would be heavy, but is&rsquo;s far from it. Glazed IronStone remains lightweight, adding to its convenience and versatility. Strong? Yes, Attractive? Most definitely. Resistant to rust? That too, but the true difference is in the details. Imagine that someone gives you a plant, a beautiful indoor fern. You want to display it inside, but want a planter that won&rsquo;t scuff up your floors. Glazed IronStone is the perfect solution. That&rsquo;s what sets Glazed IronStone Flower Pots and Planters apart. Each has been designed with non-slip feet, made from foam, so they won&rsquo;t scratch up floors. They also have a drain plug, a crucial element in keeping the plants inside healthy for the long-term.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QQ5LzGi2L._AC_SL1080_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
