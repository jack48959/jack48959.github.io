Woodstock green jasper chime, tuned using the golden ratio, a ratio discovered by the ancient greeks and found throughout nature
Cherry finish pine wood and 5 bronze anodized aluminum square chime tubes
Windcatcher is genuine stone
Square forms along with wood and stone give this chime an air of simple sophistication
Windchime is 19-inch long</p><p>Square lines & stone accents creates an air of simple sophistication. The relaxing sound of this wind chime comes from a special tuning based on the &ldquo;Golden Ratio.&rdquo; Discovered by the ancient Greeks, this ratio also appears in the Fibonacci sequence and can be used to define the proportional patterns that are found in the structure and design of familiar garden inhabitants such as the sunflower and snail. Jasper, an opaque rock, occurs in many colors. Since the color green is said to represent healing and health, we blended green stone beads with a green, rectangular, faux jasper windcatcher to create our beautiful Green Jasper Chime. Hang this handsome windchime in your garden and experience the beauty and harmony that can come from the pleasing ratios found in nature. In 1979, Grammy Award-winning musician and instrument designer Garry Kvistad created the first Woodstock Chime from an aluminum lawn chair he found in a landfill. Fascinated by the Scale of Olympos, a 7th century pentatonic scale that can’t be played on a modern piano, Garry cut and tuned the lawn chair tubes to the exact frequency of the ancient scale. The resulting Chimes of Olympos was the first Woodstock Chime and is still one of our best selling, musically-tuned windchimes. Garry and his wife Diane still develop the chimes today as part of their family-owned business in New York’s Hudson Valley.
