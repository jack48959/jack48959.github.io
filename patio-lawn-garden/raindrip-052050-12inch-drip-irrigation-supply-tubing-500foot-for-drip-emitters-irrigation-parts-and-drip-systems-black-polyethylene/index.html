CONNECT TO DRIP IRRIGATION PARTS: To use as a main supply line, attach to a point-of-connection device connected to the water source; to use as a feeder line, connect to the main line with a fitting; to use as a dripper line, attach emitters directly into the line
MULTIPLE USES: For trees, shrubs, flower beds, groundcover, vegetable gardens, plants in pots, planter boxes, and hanging baskets
BUILT FOR DURABILITY: Poly tubing is constructed using a layering method for durability: the outer layer, which is exposed to the sun, and the inner layer, which is exposed to water, is made of 100% virgin content; the middle layer is composed of recycled content
SPECIFICATIONS: Comes with one 500 ft. coil of 1/2 in. poly supply tubing; Tubing outside diameter (OD) is 0.620 in., internal diameter (ID) is 0.520. in.</p><p>Use the ½ in. distribution tubing to transport water directly to your plants. Works as a supply line to an emitter or a feeder line branching off larger tubing or pipe. Another use is to punch emitters directly into the side of the tubing to deliver water along the way. The ½ in. tubing features an outside diameter (OD) of 0.620 in. & internal diameter (ID) of 0.520 in. While other manufacturers use blended recycled material to construct their entire tubing, Raindrip poly tubing has a unique layering method using 100% virgin content for the outer and inner layers for a more durable product, and middle layer of recycled content. Drip irrigation systems are easy to customize, install, and operate. As part of a complete system, the supply tubing transports water to the area to be irrigated. Drip irrigation gradually and evenly waters the root zone of your plants, keeping it moist but never saturated with water. Your plants maintain the ideal balance between water and air for optimal growth and overall health. Raindrip is a leading manufacturer of drip and micro-irrigation solutions and the trusted brand of landscapers since 1972. Build, expand, or repair your system with our rigorously tested products designed to save you time and money.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oyQ6kQ7xL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
