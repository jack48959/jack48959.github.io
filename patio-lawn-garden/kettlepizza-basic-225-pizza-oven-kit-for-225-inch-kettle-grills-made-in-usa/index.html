Some basic assembly is required (no tools needed). The product is proudly Made in USA and has patents pending. Note: buyers must first have a kettle grill such as a Weber One Touch 22.5 Inch Gold or Silver.
How KettlePizza Works
Everyone wants to cook pizza on their grill. Traditional grills, however, are not suited for cooking pizza. Pizza needs high heat and constant temperature to cook properly. This is difficult to achieve in a regular grill because the constant opening/closing of the grill top leads to massive variations in cooking temperature. The common result is a well-done bottom and under-cooked toppings.
KettlePizza solved this problem by designing a stainless steel sleeve that fits between the kettle grill bottom and top creating a cooking chamber. There is an opening in the front that allows access to the chamber. The heat comes up from the back of the kettle, along the rear of the cooking chamber and over the top exiting the front opening. This creates a consistent heat loss that forces heat over the top of the pizza ensuring a properly cooked top. A door is not necessary and the product can maintain consistent temperatures upwards of 750 degrees F with a base of charcoal and hard wood.
Achieve Temperatures up to 900 Degress with No Door Needed
The KettlePizza, during testing, has achieved temperatures of up to 900 degrees using a mixture of charcoal and hardwood. These tests were done with thermocouples set up inside the dome and at the opening of the pizza oven. Stone temperatures above 650 degrees F. are common as well.
Wondering why there is no door? With KettlePizza, there is no reason for one&ndash;after all, most traditional pizza ovens do not have doors. The goal is for consistent heat loss that flows over the top of the pizza as it exits the opening. The result is a steady, high cooking temperature that still gives you full access to what&rsquo;s cooking.
Cook More Than Just Pizza
The KettlePizza is not just for pizza. Using pizza pans and skillets, almost any food can be cooked. If you purchase an extra grill grate, they can be added to the top standoffs, creating a &ldquo;double stack&rdquo;. This will double the cooking surface of your traditional kettle grill.
