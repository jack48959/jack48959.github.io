Dry Fast Open Cell Foam is a great-quality open cell foam, also known as reticulated foam, with a medium firm feel. Well suited for patio cushions and seating, boat cushion replacements, cabin seating and mattresses. Dry fast foam has a density of 1.8 pounds per cubic foot and a foam IFD (Indentation Force Deflection) of 33 pounds; 100% recovery rate and lasts from 3-7yrs.
Crafted to withstand the elements, Dry Fast Foam is designed with open pores in the foam to allow for water and air to pass through, making it the ideal choice for both indoor, outdoor, and marine applications. No need to worry about sudden rain showers or accidental spills – enjoy your seating without the stress of water damage. Virtually maintenance-free foam in sun, rain and even snow.
Our premium foam is the epitome of American craftsmanship– proudly made in the USA. Crafted with precision and passion, our foam reflects the dedication to excellence that defines American craftsmanship. Unboxing: Allow the foam to breathe by leaving it exposed to the air for 24-72 hours. This will help the foam expand and return to its original shape.
Don&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re looking for? Please contact us for your custom foam, mattress replacement, and indoor/outdoor cushion needs! We offer a variety of foam types, cut special shapes, and can source fabric as well!</p><p>Dry Fast foams are suited for outdoor use where moisture and precipitation like rain is prevalent, such as in patio furniture, or in marine cushioning on personal watercraft. The large, open cells provide a degree of airflow not present in other foams, allowing it to dry quickly, even after complete saturation. Because of the air flow, Dryfast foam could also be used in home products like bedding. Dry Fast Foam is a durable and beneficial filling for cushions of all shapes for many uses including boating and outdoor patio furniture. The Polyurethane in Dry Fast Foam is designed to withstand water damage. The cellular structure of the material allows air to flow more quickly and efficiently. This results in cushions drying quickly. A 50% restocking fee may apply for all returned items.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81opeE8VHyL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
