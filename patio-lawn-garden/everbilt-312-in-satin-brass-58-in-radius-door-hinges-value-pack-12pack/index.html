The Ultimate pool cover is comprised of a number of refined manufacturing techniques and materials to produce the best pool cover made today for above ground pools. Using Armorkote material, which is specially designed to prevent pin holing of the cover, we have added a 6in. panel of our patented enviro cover mesh material reinforced with lace coating to allow the water to pass through whilst keeping out debris. The perimeter binding is unique to the industry. Tired of cheap grommets that literally can bend in your fingers and continually rip out of the cover; HPI has redefined the measure of quality. We use three layers of material on our perimeter binding and each foot as the binding is passed through our folders we insert a piece of heavy vinyl so that when the grommet is punched through it is going into the vinyl. This is the only reinforced grommet in the industry. The cover is then secured to the pool using Transport truck grade rubber bungee cords. Two tec screws are drilled into the uprights and hold in place a heavy-duty non-rusting bracket. The heavy duty bungee cords are then placed through the eyelets of the grommets spaced every 1ft. around the perimeter of the cover, through the bracket on the upright and back into another grommet. This pattern is repeated around the perimeter of the pool. Add in, to prevent abrasion of the material on the top seat of the cover or under the cover we include a heavy duty spun bound geotextile material to act as padding. As the cover moves over the course of the winter, the padding will help to reduce scraping of the material providing a longer lasting cover.Features: There is a 4 ft. overlap on these covers 10 Year Warranty (2 Years Full)</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51r8e2o4mPL._AC_SL1000_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/patio-lawn-garden/everday-doormat-welcome-home-natural-coir-fiber-doormat-17-x-29-everday-welcome-door-mat-anti-slip-rubber-backing/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Everday Doormat - Welcome Home - Natural Coir Fiber Doormat - 17 x 29 Everday Welcome Door Mat - Anti Slip Rubber Backing">&larr;
