SPOIL YOURSELF - The tufted design with poly fill is the a popular choice for any comfortable cushion out there. We use a thick, polyester filling that provides the perfect amount of cushion for your hard indoor and outdoor chairs. Over the years we have experimented different constructions and listened to your feedback and created a chair pad that is so soft and pleasant; a must have for all of your chairs.
TIES TO STAY PUT - We understand the frustration caused by chair pads when they don&rsquo;t stay in place. One of the most important qualities of a chair cushion is the ability to stay in place with frequent usage. Chair pads throughout the years have utilized ties, two on each pad, to keep your cushions on your chair - where they belong. Why? Because they work! Buy a 2 pack, 4 pack, or 6 packtoday to put a comfy, cozy, and chair pad on all of your chairs once and for all.
PERFECT FIT FOR ANY CHAIR - Sit in comfort for years to come! Our chair pads are designed to fit all chairs. These cushions have a tufted square shape, and measure 16" x 16". These dimensions are a perfect fit for almost all dining room, living room, play room, bedroom, and even outdoor chairs (we do not recommend leaving these chair pads outside, but may be used on outdoor chairs and brought inside when done).
DELIGHTFUL LOOK VERSATILE DESIGN - The cover of these cushions utilize a printed tufted design that is a perfect fit for any decor. The available patterns are stylish and unique which looks beautiful on any chair. Conveniently available in 7 colors and prints, choose one to match your chair directly, or another color to accent the chair. These chair pads are available in Black, Chocolate Brown, Burgundy Red, American Flag, Buffalo Check Black, Buffalo Check Navy, and Buffalo Check Burgundy.
DURABLE, LONG LASTING, EASY TO CARE - To us, every stitch matters. We want you to be sitting on Sweet Home Collection Printed Indoor/Outdoor Chair Pads for chairs and chairs to come! Strength and durability and built into every inch. To top it all off, these cushions are MACHINE WASHABLE! Machine wash cold, do not bleach, do not iron, just tumble dry with no heat and your chair pads will look as good as new. Sit with comfort and relaxation, sit with Sweet Home Collection. NOTE: These chair pads, although able to be used outdoors, are not weather-proof, water resistent, etc.</p><p>The Sweet Home Collection American Flag Chair pad features tufted construction and is designed to be just right, not too fluffy and not too flat. Two ties at the back of the chair pad allows it to be neatly tied to chair rungs. Attractive Look Thick Comfortable Padding. Set of 4 Available in multiple colors!
