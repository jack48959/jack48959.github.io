Included Components: Bowling Ball, 10 Weighted Plastic Bowling Pins, Set Up Sheet, Score Pad
Sport Type: Playground</p><p>10 PIN BOWLING
Rack &rsquo;em up. Practice and play with this all-in-one bowling kit. Each set comes with a lightweight rubber bowling ball and classic white red-tipped plastic pins, replicating official pin sets used by professionals. Whether you&rsquo;re just learning the game of bowling, teaching the game to students or refining your aim, our kit has the perfect accessories to help get the job done.
ADD WEIGHT FOR STABILITY
Unlike many hollow shell toy pins that fall over at the slightest tremor, our plastic bowling pins can be weighted so they keep standing until you bowl them over. Use them inside on the carpet, outside on the driveway, and even in the yard for hours of fun that the entire family will enjoy.
PERFECT FOR PRACTICE
The plastic construction is dense yet lightweight. This makes for easy set up for anyone who wants to refine his or her angling, control, and overall technique on multiple surfaces. Work on your strikes and splits so you&rsquo;ll be ready for the big leagues.
SET SHEET, SCORE PAD
Don&rsquo;t worry about not setting up the pins correctly. We&rsquo;ve included a set up sheet so you can perfectly rack the pins on your surface of choice. You can then begin tracking your scores and those of your friends and family with the stat sheet. The more you practice, the higher your score will go!
