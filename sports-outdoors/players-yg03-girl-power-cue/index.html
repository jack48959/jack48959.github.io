The wood is treated with Nelsonite, a patented stabilizer that protects it from atmospheric changes and finished with an epoxy that seals the wood pores for even greater moisture protection. Once the cue design and/or inlay is applied, each completed cue is then finished with a high gloss super UV coating that provides an armor coating against fading and chipping so in 20 years your cue will look and play as good as it does today. Players pool cue shafts are made of the same treated North American Grade A Hard Rock Maple as the cue butts and are given a professional taper for a long stroke and treated with a special French cue wax that provides a smooth finish so the shaft literally glides through your fingers. Players Youth and Players Baby pool cues come backed by a one (1) year warranty against manufacturer defects.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413Yze25LUL._AC_SL1400_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/sports-outdoors/pledge-allegiance-to-the-flag-wall-decals-vehicle-decal-white-gloss-outdoor/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pledge Allegiance to The Flag, Wall Decals, Vehicle Decal (White Gloss (Outdoor))">&larr;
