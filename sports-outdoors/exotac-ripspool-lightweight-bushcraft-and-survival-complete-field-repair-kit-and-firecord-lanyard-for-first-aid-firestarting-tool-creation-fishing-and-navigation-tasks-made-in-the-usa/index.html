HIGH-STRENGTH SYNTHETIC LINE: Over 60 ft. (18 m) of 30 lb. test synthetic braided line to be used for re-stitched gear, creating tools, or as an improvised fishing kit.
HEAVY-DUTY REPAIR TAPE: The over 50 in. (127 cm) of repair tape can be used for patching holes, as an improvised bandage, creating bush-crafting tools, or even as tinder (yes, itâ€™s flammable!)

FIRECORD LANYARD: The included lanyard has an inner (red) core that can be pulled out and used as tinder. It burns like a candle wick and can be lit with any of our ferrocerium firestarters, as well as our nanoSPARK.</p><p>The Exotac ripSPOOL is a lightweight, complete field repair kit that can also be used for multiple survival and bushcraft tasks.
