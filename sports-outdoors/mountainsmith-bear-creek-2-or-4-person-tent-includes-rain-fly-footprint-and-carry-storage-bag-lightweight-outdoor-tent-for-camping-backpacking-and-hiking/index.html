The 2-person tent features 30.5 sq ft of interior usable space, accommodating 2 adults. The Bear Creek Tent is easy to set up and offers best-in-class waterproof coatings on the floor and fly. The included footprint not only offers an added layer of protection between the floor and the ground, but it can also be set up with the tent fly for the added versatility of a fast fly, lightweight set-up. The Bear Creek 4 Tentâ€™s spacious interior fits four adults, so whether we&rsquo;re dancing the weekend away at a music festival or spending a night under the stars, the whole squad is there. The Fast fly set-up is easy to put together and the footprint protects us and our pals from dirt and bugs while roughing it. The tent fly ventilation windows prevent overeating on toasty summer days and the interior mesh storage pockets keep your small items separate from your friends.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bsWhdpxhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
