The tips of the spikes are sharp and can penetrate the lawn base (grass, sand, clay, etc. ) easily and stay in place. They are easy to use & durable enough without bending.
STRONG AND SECURE: Get a solid hold on any inflatable, event tent, or camping canopy with these durable ground stakes. These robust stakes are constructed from heavy-duty steel alloy and provide an ultra-strong grip when anchoring equipment into the ground.
HIGH-STRENGTH DOUBLE HEAD STYLE: Our metal tent pegs are designed for convenient usage. Featuring a double head design with heat drawn tips, not only will it help maintain the shape, but it will also hold the tent in place. The double head design means that when driven into the ground, the first head can be driven flush, while the second head remains above the ground as an area to grip, making extracting these stakes even easier.
VERSATILE USAGE: We have developed these heavy-duty metal lawn spikes with endless uses. Secure and support your inflatables such as bounce houses, waterslides, and holiday decor, as well as party tents, gazebos, and canopies. These tent spikes can be used in a variety of landscaping or gardening applications.
STAKE DIMENSIONS: Each of our metal stakes measure 1 inch in diameter, are 40 inches long, and have 2 inch wide head to accommodate a wide variety of straps and rope.</p><p>Add more stability to your inflatables and tents with these heavy-duty metal tent stakes. The sharp tips make it easy to penetrate the lawn base easily to keep your gear sturdy even through harsh winds. At 1 x 40 inches, these robust and durable ground stakes are engineered to hold your inflatable playground, tent, or camping canopy with ease. Constructed using rugged steel alloy and an intentionally textured surface, our ground spikes provide intensive holding power and stand up to long-term usage. The double-head design has a greater advantage as it can be driven fully into the ground, keeping your ratchet D-ring fully secured and preventing movement. However, it still leaves the second stake head above ground as an area to grip which makes extracting even easier. Ideal for those who hate the hassle of complicated digging tools, their quick setup will make your outdoor experience a whole lot better! Our versatile metal tent stakes are designed to be used in multiple applications and weather conditions. These must-have pieces of equipment can support various inflatables, decorations, garden fencing posts, sun shelters and so much more.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51oenXMMyWL._AC_SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
