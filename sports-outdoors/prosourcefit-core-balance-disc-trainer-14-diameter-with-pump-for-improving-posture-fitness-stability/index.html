Exercise guide is included.
NON-SLIP GRIP – 2” rubber wheel with tread provides excellent stability & non-slip traction for smooth rolling so you can maintain proper form
COMFORT HANDLES – Two cushioned handles with finger grooves provide superior grip, control and comfort as you exercise
TAKE ANYWHERE - This simple, yet effective tool can be used at home, the gym, or carried in your car for workouts anywhere; compact for easy storage
EASY ASSEMBLY - Requires minimal assembly - put together quickly so you can tighten and tone your core and abdominal muscles right away</p><p>Whether you’re shooting to sculpt a six-pack, or you need a stronger core for your sport, the ProsourceFit Ab Wheel Roller is the perfect piece of fitness equipment to get your abs in shape. This classic ab workout tool looks simple, but it’s incredibly challenging and a quick way to tighten up your tummy. Not only that, but you will also build the muscles in your arms and back as you maneuver the wheel and hold yourself in a balanced position. Our upgraded version of the wheel makes ab rollouts more comfortable and aids in stability to help you maintain proper form and avoid injury. Cushioned handles with finger grooves provides a comfortable, firm grip to reduce hand fatigue while rolling. A thick 2-inch rubber wheel with tread gives you superior traction and smooth rolling. Steel rods and PP plastic offer durability for a fitness tool you can count on to perform workout after workout. The small, compact design makes if great for use at home, the gym, and storing in your car trunk for mobile exercise routines. To perform ab rollouts, position yourself on your knees with arms extended in front of you gripping the wheel. Flex abs and keep them engaged as you roll forward as far as is comfortable for you without back strain. Make sure to maintain a flat back. Even a slight extension will provide a great workout as you build towards a full extension. You can also roll out slightly to the right or the left to target your obliques more. Or hold a plank position on your toes while holding the roller beneath your shoulders. This no-weights-required workout is a much more efficient way to target your abs than crunches or sit-ups, because it also targets other core muscles at once beyond the “six-pack abs”, to strengthen your lower back and deep stabilizing muscles. Plus, you can purchase with confidence with a limited lifetime warranty!</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81snUR-T28L._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
