Please verify the size of your wheel stem prior to ordering</p><p>IKEA STEM SIZE 3/8&rsquo;&rsquo; ( 10 mm) - FIT IKEA CHAIRS ONLY
Sick of seeing the scratches and scuffs your office chair leaves on your favorite floor?
Tired of the constant scraping noise when moving the task chair?
All manufacturers of office and computer chairs today equip them with
cheap black plastic wheels.
Over time, these will
scratch your floors more and more
. Sure, you can try floor plastic mats - but they can't save your floors from damage. Small dust particles will fall between the floor and the mat - and still leave your expensive flooring scuffed.
Try Roller Skates Style 3-inch Caster Wheels pack!
Simply replace your old low quality plastic casters with Seddox wheels - they're durable and safe for all floors especially wooden. Soft noiseless casters - made from high quality polyurethane – will reliably protect all kinds of floor, including wood and hardwood flooring, laminate, vinyl and tile flooring. The Precision Ball Bearings built into the construction of the wheel and frame will ensure velvet-smooth and noiseless chair movement.
