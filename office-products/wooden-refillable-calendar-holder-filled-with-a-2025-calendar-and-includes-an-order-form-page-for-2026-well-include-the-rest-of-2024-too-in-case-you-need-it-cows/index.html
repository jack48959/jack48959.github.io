<em><strong>Kim&rsquo;s Calendars - Handcrafted in Maine, USA, since 1988</strong></em></p><p>I have been making hand crafted calendar holders in Maine, USA since 1988! Each is made of birch and maple and has a handy pencil rail on the bottom to keep your pen or pencil where you need it (sorry, the pen is not included). It is filled with a 2025 calendar and includes an order form page for 2026. The calendar pages, printed on recycled paper, are very easy to write on, even with a pencil. There is one page for each month and each shows moon phases, holidays, and the year at a glance. The wooden calendar &ldquo;top&rdquo; & &ldquo;back&rdquo; as well as the calendar pages have holes in them at the top. A rawhide lace threaded through the holes keeps the holder together and makes it easy for hanging. Refills are available every year! If you don&rsquo;t find a design you like, send me a message. I can probably work up a design just for you.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Aq+7lhUPL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/office-products/wooden-refillable-calendar-holder-filled-with-a-2025-calendar-and-includes-an-order-form-page-for-2026-well-include-the-rest-of-2024-too-in-case-you-need-it-grapes/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wooden Refillable Calendar Holder filled with a 2025 calendar and includes an order form page for 2026.
