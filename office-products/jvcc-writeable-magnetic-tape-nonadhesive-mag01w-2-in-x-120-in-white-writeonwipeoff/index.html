The side with polarity would be attracted to ferromagnetic materials such as iron, nickel, and cobalt. It would also be attracted to a magnet of the opposite polarity. The tape is NOT attracted to itself (it repels) since it would need a magnet of the opposite polarity to attract. Applications include whiteboard, warehouse labels, store/retail shelf labels, schedule/planning boards, and control charts.
The tapes marked as write-on/wipe-off have a non-porous, smooth, and shiny white vinyl surface. Writeable with a dry erase marker and just wipe off. The tapes marked as writeable have a porous, writeable, screen-printable matte white vinyl surface. Writeable with a permanent marker, or with a water-soluble marker (wipe off with a damp rag) for non-permanent applications. Note, wiping off will gray surface over time.
If your magnetic tape curls when you try to apply it to your surface, this is due to being wound in a roll and has no effect on the magnetic properties or quality of the tape. Simply unwind and cut your piece from the roll, place under a weight (e.g. a book or stack of papers) for a short period of time to help &ldquo;flatten&rdquo; out the strip of magnetic tape, then apply to your surface as normal.
