Tough, layered, unitized construction can operate clockwise or counterclockwise directions
Densities and grades ranging from soft and conformable to hard and aggressive offer utility for a wide variety of applications
Resists smearing for cleaner surfaces and less preparation
Minimizes heat build up to lessen impact on heat-sensitive materials</p><p>From the Manufacturer
The 3M™ Scotch-Brite™ EXL Unitized Wheels feature a soft, conformable consistency that effectively smoothes, deburrs and finishes the edges of metal alloys, as well as many plastics and composites. There are a wide variety of densities and grades available starting from a very soft 2 density for applications requiring a conformable product extending to a hard, aggressive 8 density for maximum cut and durability. The finished result is a clean edge without smearing, reducing the need for additional clean up and preparation. Designed for optimal performance on a die grinder, the EXL Unitized Wheel minimizes heat buildup during operation, making it ideal for use on heat sensitive materials.
The EXL Unitized Wheel is filled with abrasive minerals to quickly smooth edges of metal, plastic and composites. It is available with aluminum oxide in fine, medium, coarse and extra coarse grades, and silicon carbide in very fine and fine grades.
Scotch-Brite™ is a unique surface conditioning product with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results over the life of the product. The open-web material is load resistant and keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the nylon fibers.
For more than a century, 3M has applied innovation and technology to improving our customers’ lives and supporting their business goals. Today the company, from its headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, serves industrial and commercial customers and consumers in nearly 200 countries. Abrasive Systems products, including a complete line of coated abrasives, microfinishing and microreplicated abrasives, and hardware accessories, provide the finishing touch for almost any surface conditioning application. The 3M brand, across thousands of products, represents consistency, superior quality, and value.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YbPq5jE1L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/scotchbrite-light-deburring-wheel-silicon-carbide-6000-rpm-6-diameter-x-1-width-1-arbor-7s-fine-grit-pack-of-1/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scotch-Brite Light Deburring Wheel, Silicon Carbide, 6000 rpm, 6 Diameter x 1 Width, 1 Arbor, 7S Fine Grit (Pack of 1)">&larr;
