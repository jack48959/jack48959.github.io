Liftex is the ONLY vertically integrated sling mfg in USA. This means a higher level of quality AND supply control than anyone in the USA due to weaving their own webbing. Liftex manufactures lifting slings in multiple locations nationwide. Tested & proven world-wide. All slings meet or exceed OSHA, ASME B30.9, and WSTDA standards and regulations for strength and safety.
PRO-EDGE - UP TO 50 PERCENT TOUGHER - Lifting professionals choose Pro-Edge protection to lengthen the life of their slings. Pro-Edge is up to 50 percent tougher than standard slings. Not only does Pro-Edge offer superior abrasion and cut resistance, but also offers the industry&rsquo;s most durable tagging system. Before considering Standard Edge or Import, make sure you pay for TRUSTED quality webbing and Maximum Durability Tagging. Longer sling life. Increased safety. Trusted Slings since 1955.
LIGHTWEIGHT, STRONG - Compared to chain and wire rope slings, the user-friendly Polyester slings are lighter, more cost effective, and won&rsquo;t scratch or mar &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; loads you&rsquo;re lifting. The 2-Ply Type 3 Flat Eye web sling is versatile for all 3 hitch types - Vertical, Choker, and Basket. Unlike costly edge protection slings, Pro-Edge remains flexible and workable for you. Whichever lift you have planned, Liftex quality slings are ready for the Task. Lightweight to maneuver. Easy to store.
MAXIMUM DURABILITY TAGGING - A sling with an illegible or ripped off tag renders the sling &ldquo;out of service&rdquo; according to OSHA, ASMEB30.9 and WSTDA standards and regulations. Don&rsquo;t settle for low quality tags. Liftex web slings have a 2 Layer &ldquo;Pocket Tag&rdquo; for maximum durability protecting the required tag info. The laser-printed info includes Width, Length, Part No, and Capacities for each of the 3 hitch types (Vertical, Choker, Basket). Never use a sling without a tag and any required info.
CUSTOMIZABLE - Sling Center proudly carries Liftex full line of products. These products are available in different lengths, load capacities, and styles. When choosing the product for your business OR personal usage, trust in the brand Experts choose everyday - Liftex. Perfect for Construction, Mfg., Boat Lifts, or even your Yard work, Towing, Workshop usage, or simply moving some furniture.</p><p>Pro-Edge is different from most other premium edge slings in that the edge protection is structural – it is built into the sling. Pro-Edge features edge reinforcement with twisted tire – cord yarns – for the same reason that these yarns are used in tires – they provide maximum resistance to wear (cutting and abrasion). Additionally, the twisting of these yarns provides an enhanced degree of resistance to cutting and abrasion as compared to non-twisted yarns. Longer life means reduced cost per use. Most other premium edge products are made with non-twisted yarns and with vinyl or polymer edge coatings – coatings that can wear off over time and leave the end-user with a simple “standard” edge sling.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41DPggFjOmL.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/liftgate-for-driver-unloading-the-cabinet-curbside/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LIFTGATE for DRIVER Unloading the cabinet CURBSIDE">&larr;
