Small bearing for fitting small shaft diameters
Metal shields on both sides of the bearing keep the lubricant in and contaminants out
Pressed steel cage evenly spaces balls for reduced friction, vibration, and noise
Normal radial internal clearance for applications where thermal expansion is not a factor</p><p>This MRC R series single-row small inch-size ball bearing is double-shielded, and has a pressed steel cage and normal clearance rating. It is suitable for applications supporting high speeds, moderately heavy radial loads, and thrust loads in both directions. Made from high-carbon chromium steel, this bearing has deep inner and outer races that conform to the balls that run in them, allowing higher speeds and creating lower friction than comparable-sized roller bearings. The bearing has a small design package for fitting into compact spaces and onto small shaft sizes. Metal shields on both sides of the bearing keep out contaminants such as dirt and grime and hold in lubricant applied at manufacture. This bearing has a pressed steel cage to prevent the balls from coming into contact with each other during use, reducing friction, vibration, and noise. The bearing has an American Bearing Manufacturers Association (ABMA) C0 (normal) radial internal clearance designation, making it suitable for applications where the load and speeds do not result in thermal expansion. This clearance provides latitude for self-realignment and compensates for static and dynamic alignment errors. This small ball bearing is for use in commercial and industrial applications including household appliances, power tools, original equipment or replacement parts in motors, office automation, and conveyor rollers.
Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
MRC Bearing Services, a division of The SKF Group, manufactures a variety of ball bearings for automotive, food and beverage, energy, aerospace, and other industrial and commercial applications. Their headquarters are in Jamestown, NY.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712YcloA7vL._SL1126_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/mre-amenu-case-2018-inspection-date-military-mealreadytoeat-case-of-12-genuine-us-military-surplus-mres-with-a-case-menu-selections/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MRE A-Menu Case, 2018 Inspection Date Military Meal-Ready-to-Eat.
