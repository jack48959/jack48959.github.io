Public Squares bases and lids are sold separately to allow users full customization of their recycling centers. Bases are available in four heights and capacities. Lids are available in three dedicated styles with a round opening, square opening, or slot opening to visually indicate type of recycling for the container. Titled self-adhesive decals are supplied with each lid style to apply onto the base to identify what refuse goes in which container. Match the lid style to the right base capacity for your recycling needs. Containers can be positioned in a line or in a cube, select all the same height, or vary heights to fit your capacity requirements.
Durable and stylish for first impressions
The heavy-gauge steel base has a powder-coat paint finish and the hinged tops are specifically designed to accept cans, glass, newspaper, or waste. Lids include decals designed to segregate waste and recyclables. Steel securing wires rest on the rim of the base to hold your plastic liner bags in place. A plastic drip pan in the base helps protect floors from leaks or torn liner bags.
Containers can be positioned in a line or in a cube.
