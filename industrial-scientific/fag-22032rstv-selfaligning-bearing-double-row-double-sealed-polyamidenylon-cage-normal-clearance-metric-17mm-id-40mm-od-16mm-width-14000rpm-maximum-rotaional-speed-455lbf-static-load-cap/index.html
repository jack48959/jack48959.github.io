Straight bore for fitting on a conventional cylindrical shaft
Contact seals on both sides of the bearing keeps lubricant in and contaminants out
Glass fiber reinforced polyamide 66 plastic cage evenly spaces balls for reduced friction, vibration, and noise
Normal radial internal clearance for applications where thermal expansion is not a factor</p><p>This FAG double-row self-aligning ball bearing is double-sealed, and has a cylindrical bore, polyamide/nylon cage, and normal clearance rating. It is suitable for applications supporting moderate radial loads and moderate to low thrust loads. This bearing has concave sphered housing rings to compensate for static angular misalignments between the shaft and housing in applications subject to shaft deflections or mounting errors. Because this bearing type has the lowest operational friction of all rolling bearings, it runs cool at high speeds. This bearing is made of low-alloy, through-hardened chromium steel for durability and resistance to deformity under heavy loads. The bearing has a straight bore for fitting on a conventional cylindrical shaft. Contact seals on both sides of the bearing keep out contaminants such as dirt and grime and hold in lubricant applied at manufacturing that lasts the lifetime of the bearing. This bearing has an injection-molded snap-type cage made of glass fiber reinforced polyamide 66 to prevent the balls from coming into contact with each other during use, reducing friction, vibration, and noise. This cage type can be used at operating temperatures up to 120 degrees C (250 degrees F). The bearing has a normal radial internal clearance designation, making it suitable for applications where the load and speeds do not result in thermal expansion. This clearance provides latitude for self-realignment and compensates for static and dynamic alignment errors. Additionally, this bearing is produced to PN (normal) tolerances in accordance with Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) 620-2 standards for quality assurance. This self-aligning ball bearing is for use in commercial and industrial applications including film processing equipment, office automation, vertical spinning equipment, and industrial countershafts, among others.
Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
FAG manufactures a variety of bearings that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) standards for quality assurance. The company, founded in 1883, is based in Schweinfurt, Germany.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81skdcl5khL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/fag-22210e1kc3-spherical-roller-bearing-tapered-bore-steel-cage-c3-clearance-metric-50mm-id-90mm-od-23mm-width/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FAG 22210E1K-C3 Spherical Roller Bearing, Tapered Bore, Steel Cage, C3 Clearance, Metric, 50mm ID, 90mm OD, 23mm Width">&larr;
