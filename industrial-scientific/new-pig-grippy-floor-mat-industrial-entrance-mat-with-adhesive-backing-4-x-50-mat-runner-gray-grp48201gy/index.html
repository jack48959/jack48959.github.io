LIGHTWEIGHT & EASY TO CLEAN weighs less than rental and rubber-backed mats for less hassle, saves you on rental contracts and has a lower environmental impact; you can sweep, vacuum, mop, shop/wet vac or run your floor scrubber over it and it won&rsquo;t budge</p><p>Hassling with rubber-backed floor mats or rental mats? Make the switch to the mat that sticks; our super-safe, adhesive-backed ultra-duty floor mat creates a safe walking surface in entrances and aisleways. Stays in place for up to 3 to 6 months, depending on conditions and traffic patterns. The thinnest commercial floor mat you can buy: no rippled edges to obstruct doors or create tripping hazards. ADA compliant for wheelchairs and walkers; carts and pallet jacks roll right over it. Sticks to most commercial floor surfaces including concrete, vinyl, linoleum, ceramic tile, quarry tile and laminate flooring. Tested and Certified by the National Floor Safety Institute (NFSI): high-traction surfaces such as PIG Ultra-Duty Grippy Mat have been proven to reduce slip-and-fall claims by as much as 90%. Each mat runner roll absorbs up to 5.2 gallons. Mats take on the properties of absorbed liquids - always take proper precautions when handling saturated absorbents.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aL1VsXYUL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
