SCOTCH-BRITE EXL DEBURRING WHEEL XL-WL 8S FINE 8 IN X 1 IN X 3 IN 3 PER CASE
From the Manufacturer
The 3M™ Scotch-Brite™ EXL Deburring Wheel features a hard, dense consistency that quickly deburrs, finishes, and polishes all types of metals, composites, glass, and leaves a smooth, clean surface. Its conformable characteristic makes the wheel ideal for deburring stamped or laser cut parts, or for finishing after belt sanding. The finished result is a clean surface without smearing, reducing the need for additional clean up and preparation. Convolute construction and clean, uniform wear keep the wheel running smoothly and [help the operator attain a professional finish while minimizing fatigue. Scotch-Brite material runs cool and provides the EXL Deburring Wheel with uniform wear and keeps fresh abrasives continuously exposed, making it a superior choice on heat sensitive substrates. The toughness of the wheel extends its service life.
The Scotch-Brite™ EXL Deburring Wheel is available with silicon carbide or aluminum oxide abrasive mineral. Silicon carbide is a synthetic mineral that is very sharp and commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint prep and finishing. Aluminum oxide is a hard, blocky mineral that provides high cut-rate and long life. While silicon carbide breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a finer finish.
Scotch-Brite™ is a unique surface conditioning product with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material is load resistant and keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the nylon fibers.
For more than a century, 3M has applied innovation and technology to improving our customers’ lives and supporting their business goals. Today the company, from its headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, serves industrial and commercial customers and consumers in nearly 200 countries. Abrasive Systems products, including a complete line of coated abrasives, microfinishing and microreplicated abrasives, and hardware accessories, provide the finishing touch for almost any surface conditioning application. The 3M brand, across thousands of products, represents consistency, superior quality, and value.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91dY-ysCsrL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/scotchbrite-exl-deburring-wheel-xlwl-9s-fine-8-in-x-1-in-x-3-in/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SCOTCH-BRITE EXL DEBURRING WHEEL, XL-WL, 9S FINE, 8 IN X 1 IN X 3 IN.">&larr;
