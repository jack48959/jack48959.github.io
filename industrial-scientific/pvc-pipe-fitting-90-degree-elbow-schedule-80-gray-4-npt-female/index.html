Female NPT threads on both ends for connecting pipes with male NPT threaded ends
PVC for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and less weight than fittings made from metal
Operating temperature range of 0 to 60 degrees C (32 to 140 degrees F)
Meets ASTM D1784 and D1785 standards for quality assurance, and meets NSF standards 14 for plastic piping and 61 for potable water service</p><p>This GF Piping Systems schedule 80 PVC elbow fitting has female NPT threads on both ends and is suitable for connecting two pipes with male NPT threaded ends at a 90-degree angle to change the direction of flow between pipes. The National Pipe Taper (NPT) threads create a tighter seal than straight threads. This elbow fitting, or &ldquo;ell,&rdquo; is made of gray PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and less weight than fittings made from metal. It is compatible with schedule 80 (thick wall) PVC pipes and fittings, and is suitable for chemical processing, industrial plating, chilled water distribution, deionized water lines, and chemical drainage and wastewater treatment systems. PVC can be connected to other materials such as steel, copper, or cast iron using transition fittings. The fitting has an operating temperature range of 0 to 60 degrees C (32 to 140 degrees F), meets ASTM International D1784 and D1785 standards for quality assurance, and meets National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) standards 14 for plastic piping and 61 for potable water service. This schedule 80 PVC elbow fitting is suitable for connecting pipes for conveying drinking water, waste water, chemicals, and other liquids in a range of industries.
Pipe fittings are components used for connecting, terminating, controlling flow, and changing the direction of piping in many different industries. When purchasing pipe fittings, consider the application, as this will affect material type, shape, size and required durability. Fittings are available threaded or unthreaded, in many shapes, styles, sizes, and schedules (pipe wall thickness).
GF Piping Systems manufactures piping components and systems for gas and water distribution. The company, founded in 1802 and headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001:2008 and 14001:2004.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wyTtu4SjL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/pvc-pipe-fitting-adapter-schedule-80-gray-112-npt-female-x-slip-socket/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PVC Pipe Fitting, Adapter, Schedule 80, Gray, 1-1/2 NPT Female x Slip Socket">&larr;
