Four flutes produce a better finish than fewer flutes
High-speed steel is compatible with a variety of materials
Uncoated (bright) tools have no additional surface treatment or coating for use on a broad range of materials
Non-center-cutting design supports peripheral milling and finishing</p><p>The YG-1 E1237 uncoated high-speed steel corner rounding end mill has four flutes and a non-center-cutting design for machining fillets on a range of materials. Corner rounding end mills have a concave, curved indent on the cutting end to create a more rounded or less rounded corner, depending on the radius selected. Four flutes produce a better finish than fewer flutes. The non-center-cutting design is for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing.
High-speed steel (HSS) is a common general-purpose steel for cutting tools and is compatible with a variety of materials. This tool has no coating or surface treatment for use on a broad range of materials. The tool has a Weldon shank.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the toolâ€™s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
YG-1 manufactures drills, taps, end mills, and rotary tooling. The company, founded in 1981, is headquartered in South Korea and has a U.S. office in Vernon Hills, IL.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nyky0vL6L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/yg1-e1237-high-speed-steel-hss-corner-rounding-end-mill-weldon-shank-uncoated-bright-finish-noncenter-cutting-4-flutes-4-overall-length-19375-cutting-diameter-075-shank-diameter/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="YG-1 E1237 High Speed Steel (HSS) Corner Rounding End Mill, Weldon Shank, Uncoated (Bright) Finish, Non-Center Cutting, 4 Flutes, 4 Overall Length, 1.9375 Cutting Diameter, 0.75 Shank Diameter">&larr;
