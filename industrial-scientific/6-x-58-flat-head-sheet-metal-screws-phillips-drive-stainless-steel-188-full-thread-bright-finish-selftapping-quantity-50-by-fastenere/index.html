Fastenere brand stainless steel sheet metal screws offer the corrosion resistance and strength that makes them the best choice for an application that is exposed to a wet or damp enviroment and will withstand the test of time</p><p>Flat head has a flat top and a taper. Flat heads are designed to be used in a countersunk hole. Sheet metal screws have sharp threads that cut into a material such as sheet metal, plastic or wood. They also make excellent fasteners for attaching metal hardware to wood because the fully threaded shank provides good retention in wood.
