Phillips pan head sheet metal screws with a self tapping thread patern that forms its own threads in the material it is being screwed into and is mainly used for attatching two pieces of metal together but also works great in wood and plexiglass because of the coarse thread
Pan heads have a domed top with a flat load bearing surface on the underside that will hold materials being fastened firmly together
Made from stainless steel grade 18-8 which offers a high level of chemical and corrosion resistance that will out perform and out last all zinc plated fasteners for years with out the need to perform costly and time consuming maintenance; 18-8 stainless steel pan head sheet metal screws are a better choice than 410 self drilling screws in out door applications
Fastenere brand stainless steel sheet metal screws offer the corrosion resistance and strength that makes them the best choice for an application that is exposed to a wet or damp enviroment and will withstand the test of time</p><p>Sheet metal screws have sharp threads that cut into a material such as sheet metal, plastic or wood. They also make excellent fasteners for attaching metal hardware to wood because the fully threaded shank provides good retention in wood.
