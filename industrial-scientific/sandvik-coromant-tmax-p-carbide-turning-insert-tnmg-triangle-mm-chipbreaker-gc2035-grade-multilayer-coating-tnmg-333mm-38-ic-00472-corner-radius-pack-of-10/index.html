GC2035 grade is a PVD coating of titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) and titanium nitride (TiN) that provides shock resistance without limiting wear resistance
Triangle shape is suitable for light roughing and finishing, and is used when there is limited machine power, a tendency toward vibration, or when either a large or small lead angle is required
Roughing (MR), medium-machining (MM), and finishing (L-K, R-K) chipbreaker styles reduce buildup of chips at a range of cutting depths and feed rates
Negative double-sided insert has zero degree clearance and a strong edge for external turning</p><p>The Sandvik Coromant TNMG GC2035 indexable turning insert with a choice of MR, MM, L-K, or R-K chipbreaker style has a triangle shape with a 60-degree cutting angle, providing shock resistance without limiting wear resistance for roughing to finishing of stainless steel in difficult to average machining conditions. This double-sided negative insert has a chip groove on both sides, a hole in the center and six cutting edges. It has strong edges, zero clearance, and is a better choice for external turning than a positive insert. GC2035 grade is a combination of carbide and a coating of titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) and titanium nitride (TiN) applied through physical vapor deposition (PVD), which provides toughness for shock resistance without limiting wear resistance at low to moderate cutting speeds. Resistance to thermal shock makes this grade suitable for applications requiring fast interrupted cuts. PVD coatings give the insert longer life and better wear resistance than uncoated inserts, and maintain a sharper cutting edge than those with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coatings.
The TNMG GC2035 is available with a choice of four types of chipbreakers: MR, MM, L-K, or R-K, for a range of cutting depths and feed rates. The MR chipbreaker has the highest range of cutting depths and feed rates and should be used when high removal rate is a priority. The MM chipbreaker is designed for medium-machining cutting depths and feed rates. The R-K and L-K chipbreakers are designed for low cutting depths and feed rates and have specific rotation direction requirements. The R -K chipbreaker is for right-handed turning operations, and the L-K chipbreaker is for left-handed turning operations. These chipbreakers generate low cutting forces and are suitable for slender shafts and thin-walled components.
Tolerance of the distance from the base to the tip of the triangle is + or - 0.002” to 0.005”. Tolerance of the theoretical diameter of the insert is + or - 0.002” to 0.005”. Insert thickness tolerance is + or - 0.005”. Different insert shapes and sizes may have different inscribed circle (iC) measurements, which are related to the insert’s range of cutting depths, speeds, lead angle, and feed rates. The inscribed circle is the largest circle that can be drawn within the edges of the insert shape. In general, as the insert size and iC become larger, the maximum cutting depth increases. The cutting depth influences the metal removal rate, number of cuts, chip evacuation, and power required when using the insert.
Indexable inserts are small cutting tools designed to remove material in external and internal cutting applications such as turning, milling, drilling, and grooving. They are held by an insert holder, have multiple cutting edges, and can be rotated when one edge wears down. Multiple inserts can be used to accomplish a variety of cuts in one operation. An insert is either positive or negative, which refers to the rake or clearance angle at which the insert removes material. Inserts are coded according to their specific cutting and application capability (e.g. VNMG 16 04 04-QM). Each part of the code represents details of the insert shape, nose angle, clearance, tolerance, size, geometry, grade, and chipbreaker style.
Sandvik Coromant manufactures tools for turning, milling, and drilling. The company, headquartered in Sweden, makes tools used throughout the metalworking field, including the automotive and aerospace, die and mold, and general engineering industries. Sandvik Coromant inserts meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.
Matching Inserts to Holders
These inserts are part of the Sandvik Coromant TMax P Negative Insert family, which means they can be used with CoroTurn RC, a clamp-style insert holding system. This system is for use when stability and security are essential for productive turning of large components. The system is mostly used for external turning, from roughing to finishing, but also for internal turning.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l6jotka8L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/sandvik-coromant-tmax-p-carbide-turning-insert-tnmm-triangle-mr-chipbreaker-gc2025-grade-multilayer-coating-tnmm-433mr-12-ic-00472-corner-radius-pack-of-10/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandvik Coromant T-Max P Carbide Turning Insert, TNMM, Triangle, MR Chipbreaker, GC2025 Grade, Multi-Layer Coating, TNMM 433-MR, 1/2 iC, 0.0472 Corner Radius (Pack of 10)">&larr;
