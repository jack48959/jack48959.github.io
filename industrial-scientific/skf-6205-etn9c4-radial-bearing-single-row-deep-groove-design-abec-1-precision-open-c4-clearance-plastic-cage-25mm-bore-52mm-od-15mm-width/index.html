Single-row bearing for supporting radial loads
C4 radial internal clearance for radial slack between the inner and outer rings that is greater than CN (normal) and C3 to compensate for thermal expansion
Conforms to ABEC 1 precision standard for performance within a narrow range of variation
Brass cage evenly spaces the balls for even load distribution and prevents contact to reduce friction, vibrations, and noise</p><p>The SKF radial bearing is an open bearing with Annular Bearing Engineering Committee (ABEC) 1 precision and C4 clearance and has a single-row deep-groove geometry for high speeds and supporting both radial and axial loads. This bearing conforms to the precision standard ABEC 1 for performance within a narrow range of variation and has C4 radial internal clearance for radial slack between the inner and outer rings that is greater than CN (normal) and C3 to compensate for thermal expansion. The brass cage evenly spaces the balls for even load distribution and prevents contact to reduce friction, vibrations, and noise. The bearing has an open configuration for lubrication in place and applications involving minimal exposure to dirt, grime, debris, and other contaminants. This radial bearing is for use in applications that involve combined radial and axial loads and a need for high running accuracy and stiffness at high rotational speeds. Such applications include clutches, drives, gearboxes, compressors, pumps, turbines, and printing and textile machines, among others.
Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
SKF Group manufactures bearings and units, seals, mechatronics, and lubrication systems that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 and 9001, and Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS) 18001 standards for quality assurance. The company, founded in 1907, is headquartered in Göteborg, Sweden.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jsQcOW4RL._SL1278_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/skf-6205-tn9c3-radial-bearing-single-row-deep-groove-design-abec-1-precision-open-c3-clearance-plastic-cage-25mm-bore-52mm-od-15mm-width/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SKF 6205 TN9/C3 Radial Bearing, Single Row, Deep Groove Design, ABEC 1 Precision, Open, C3 Clearance, Plastic Cage, 25mm Bore, 52mm OD, 15mm Width">&larr;
