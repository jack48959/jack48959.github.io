Center-cutting design allows the end mill to plunge into material like a drill bit while performing conventional surface milling</p><p>The YG-1 E2482 uncoated cobalt steel metric square nose end mill has two flutes, a center-cutting design, and a 30-degree helix angle for slotting, pocketing, keyway cutting, and other general-purpose machining on a range of materials. The two flutes have better chip-carrying capacity than end mills with more flutes while offering additional support when the tool goes deep into the material in applications with a high depth of cut. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit. The tool’s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts. The 30-degree helix angle supports general-purpose applications. It balances lower angles’ strong cutting edge for difficult-to-machine materials with higher angles’ increased cutting action.
Cobalt steel can be run at faster speeds and stays sharp longer than high-speed steel tools, while offering resistance to heat and abrasion. With no coating or surface treatment, this uncoated tool can be used on a range of materials. Cutting diameter is metric. Cutting diameter tolerance is + 0.02 to - 0.00 mm for end mills with a different shank and cutting diameter and + 0.04 to - 0.00 mm for end mills with the same shank and cutting diameter. The tool has a Weldon shank.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool’s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
YG-1 manufactures drills, taps, end mills, and rotary tooling. The company, founded in 1981, is headquartered in South Korea and has a U.S. office in Vernon Hills, IL.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71y0dHwkpxL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/yg1-e2482-cobalt-steel-square-nose-end-mill-metric-weldon-shank-uncoated-bright-finish-30-deg-helix-2-flutes-23125-overall-length-9mm-cutting-diameter-0375-shank-diameter/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="YG-1 E2482 Cobalt Steel Square Nose End Mill, Metric, Weldon Shank, Uncoated (Bright) Finish, 30 Deg Helix, 2 Flutes, 2.3125 Overall Length, 9mm Cutting Diameter, 0.375 Shank Diameter">&larr;
