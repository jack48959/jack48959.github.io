Supports both radial loads and thrust loads in one direction
Through-hardened alloy steel for strength and durability
Heat-treated rollers with a layer of Austenite that increases compressive load capacity, corrosion resistance, and service life
Steel cage evenly spaces rollers for reduced friction, vibration and noise</p><p>This NTN single cone, straight bore, steel tapered roller bearing matches with a single or double cup ( sold separately) to assemble into a complete tapered roller bearing, suitable for applications that support radial loads and one direction thrust loads. This single cone bearing works with both straight and flanged cups. Typically mounted in opposing pairs on a shaft to evenly distribute loads, this single cone (inner ring) is made of through-hardened alloy steel for durability, heat tolerance, and resistance to deformity under heavy loads. The rollers are heat-treated and coated with a thin layer of Austenite, increasing their compressive load capacity, corrosion resistance, and service life. The steel cage prevents the rollers from coming into contact during use, reducing friction, vibrations, and noise. As part of a separable tapered roller bearing unit, this single cone assembly has an open design that allows for lubrication and adjustments. This tapered roller bearing is suitable for use in high-load, moderate-speed applications such as automotive axle systems and conveyor systems in heavy duty industries such as mining, construction, and agriculture, among others.
Specifications Met
General ISO quality requirements for manufacture of tapered roller bearings ISO 9001 Automotive industry-related ISO quality requirements for design and manufacture of tapered roller bearings ISO 16949 Environmental ISO quality requirements for manufacture of tapered roller bearings ISO 14001
Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
NTN manufactures bearings, joints, hubs, components, and assemblies that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards for quality assurance. The company, founded in 1918, is based in Osaka, Japan.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514c7EKrQuL._SL1005_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/ntn-46176-tapered-roller-bearing-single-cone-standard-tolerance-straight-bore-steel-inch-134-bore-1-14-width/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NTN 46176 Tapered Roller Bearing, Single Cone, Standard Tolerance, Straight Bore, Steel, Inch, 1-3/4 Bore, 1 1/4 Width">&larr;
