Carbide is harder than high-speed or cobalt steel, making it more wear resistant at high speeds and providing longer tool life.</p><p>The YG-1 EMB20 AlTiN-coated carbide long-reach square nose end mill has a variable helix, four flutes, and a center-cutting design for high-performance machining on alloy steel, cast iron, stainless steel, titanium, nickel-based alloys, and most materials with a Rockwell hardness less than C40. Variable-helix end mills combine varying helix angles with unequal flute spacing to reduce harmful vibration between the tool and the workpiece, improve surface finish, and provide higher cutting capacity and material-removal rates compared to conventional end mills. The long-reach shank provides greater access to recessed areas of the workpiece than tools with a standard shank length. (Feed should be reduced.) Four flutes produce a better finish than fewer flutes. The tool’s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit.
The AlTiN coating resists heat better than TiN, TiAlN, and TiCN coatings, increasing tool life and performance. It also offers increased hardness compared to TiN and may reduce the need for lubricants, based on the application. (AlTiN is suitable for a range of materials, but TiCN or uncoated end mills are recommended for machining aluminum.) The carbide substrate is harder than high-speed or cobalt steel, making it more wear resistant at high speeds and providing longer tool life. Cutting diameter tolerance is + 0.00 to - 0.0012". End mills with a shank diameter below 3/8" have a round shank. End mills with a shank diameter 3/8" and larger have a Weldon shank.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the tool’s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
YG-1 manufactures drills, taps, end mills, and rotary tooling. The company, founded in 1981, is headquartered in South Korea and has a U.S. office in Vernon Hills, IL.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71PJmQwqv-L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
