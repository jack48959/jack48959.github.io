3M Flap Disc 577F tackles the toughest high-pressure metalworking applications and leaves a blended finish, all in a single step. Our abrasive flap disc features fast-cutting alumina zirconia mineral on durable polyester-backed flaps for extra cutting power, and long life on heavy duty applications such as weld removal, sharp-edge work, and beveling.
From the Manufacturer
The 3Mâ„¢ Flap Disc 577F Type 29 quick change disc combines grinding and blending into a single step to tackle aggressive stock removal on a variety of welds, coatings, and other metal fabrication applications and at the same time produce a blended finish on the workpiece, offering labor cost savings on heavy-duty jobs. The 577F abrasive flap disc features fast-cutting alumina zirconia mineral on durable polyester-backed flaps for extra cutting power, and long life on heavy duty applications such as weld removal, sharp-edge work, and beveling. A grinding aid reduces grinding temperatures for processes involving heat-sensitive alloys such as stainless steel, nickel alloys, and titanium.
Ideal for tough grinding applications where final finish is important, the overlapping layers of the flaps continually wear away with use to expose fresh abrasive mineral for a fast, consistent cut, while the cushioning of the flaps creates a blended finish. Flap discs typically generate a finish one grade finer than the disc is graded, reducing finishing steps. Type 29 is angled for aggressive stock removal and fast cutting on both flat and curved surfaces.
Each quick change disc comes packaged with a disposable attachment hub and has a threaded center hole for attachment to a right angle grinder. Four inch discs have a 3/8 inch threaded center hole; 4-1/2 and 7 inch discs have a 5/8 inch threaded center hole. The 4 and 4-1/2 inch diameter discs have a max RPM of 13,300, and the 7 inch discs have a max RPM of 8,600.
Flap discs are three-dimensional grinding discs with overlapping layers of abrasive-coated, fiber-reinforced flaps that fan out from a central hub. These flaps continually wear away with use to expose fresh mineral for a fast, consistent cut. The one-step alternative to bonded wheels and fiber discs, flap discs grind and finish in a single step, making them a time and cost-saving solution in many typical applications. Under normal conditions, flap discs will generate a finish that is one grade finer than the finish of a fibre disc of the same grade. And, because their overlapping construction allows more abrasive material to be loaded onto the cutting surface, they far outlast typical discs. Flap discs have the flexibility to easily follow curves and contours while delivering less gouging and enhancing operator comfort. They are ideal for a wide range of applications, including weld grinding, deburring, rust removal, edge grinding, and weld seam blending.
