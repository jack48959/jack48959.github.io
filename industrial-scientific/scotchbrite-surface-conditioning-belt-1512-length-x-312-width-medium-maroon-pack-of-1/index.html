Medium grade abrasive provides ideal starting point for final finishing of stainless steel
Reduced loading and heat build-up allow extended operating time and consistent surface conditioning results
Reinforced backing and non-woven open web material provides superior flexibility for detail work, over contours and edges
Removes surface imperfections, grindlines, mill, and other marks</p><p>From the Manufacturer
The 3M™ Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Belt in medium grade is a durable belt engineered to perform detail work such as finishing, cleaning, finishing, blending, and light deburring on a variety of metals. Medium grade abrasive and high operating speed provides an effective means to achieve #4 stainless steel finishes. The non-woven fiber construction runs cool, resists loading, and maintains edge durability while aluminum oxide abrasives provide a high cut-rate for consistent finishing performance over the life of the belt. The 3M™ Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning belt works well to remove coarse grindlines, mill marks, or small burrs left by cutting tools or conventional abrasives. Thin width belts are ideal for blending and finishing right angle welds on stainless steel
The Scotch-Brite Surface Conditioning Belt uses course grade aluminum oxide abrasive. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its cut-rate and long life. This mineral is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives, such as garnet, quickly wear down with use. Due to its high cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide mineral is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing use. Aluminum oxide is suitable on a wide variety of substrates in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys.
Belt sanders are used for rapid grinding, sanding and finishing on a variety of surfaces. Depending on the material being worked, sanding wheels and discs may clog, quickly making them less efficient, while belt sanders continue to sand without clogging because small grooves in the abrasive belt open as they go around the arc of the drive wheel.
