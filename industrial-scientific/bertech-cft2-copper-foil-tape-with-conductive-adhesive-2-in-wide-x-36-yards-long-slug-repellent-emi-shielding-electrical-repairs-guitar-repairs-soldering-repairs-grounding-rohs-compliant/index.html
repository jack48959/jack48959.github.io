COPPER FOIL TAPE MATERIAL: Our Copper Foil Tape is made up of Copper Film and comes with a conductive acrylic adhesive designed to help with various applications from crafts, electronics, grounding, and gardening
COPPER FOIL TAPE LENGTH: Each roll of the Bertech Copper Foil Tape comes as a 36 yard roll or 108 Feet or 32.9 Meters
COPPER FOIL TAPE SPECS: The Bertech Copper Foil Tape is 2.6 Mil Thick, which includes 1.4 Mil of Copper Film and 1.2 Mil Conductive Adhesive. They have a Tensile Strength: 25 lbs./in; and has a Shielding Effectiveness of 60db – 80db
COPPER FOIL TAPE APPLICATIONS: Aerospace Assembly, EMI Shielding, Cable Shielding, RFI Shielding, Guitar Repair, Electronic Assembly, Semi-conductor Facilities, Grounding, Crafts and Decoration</p><p>&ldquo;Bertech Copper Foil Tape with Conductive Adhesive are also known as EMI Shielding Tape or RFI Shielding Tapes. They are made from thin copper foil with an acrylic conductive adhesive. These copper foil tapes are packaged on a paper liner on a 3 inch core for easy handling and cutting. The Copper Foil tapes provide a very low rate of electrical resistance and come with a conductive adhesive. The Bertech Copper Foil Tapes can also be used for building ground systems, static charge draining, cable wrapping and, surface contact to non-solderable material and point to point electrical contact. The Copper Foil Tapes are also RoHS & REACH Compliant. The Bertech Copper Foil Tapes can be used for many applications: ELECTRICAL REPAIRS: Bertech Copper Foil Tapes have high conductivity and low resistance which make them great for any electrical or do it yourself repairs. A great use for the Bertech Copper Foil Tape can be used to shield speaker wire from interference. Wrap the tape around wires that are too close together to stop a hum or buzz coming through your speaker system. Copper Foil Tape Technical Specifications: Color: Copper Adhesion Type: Electrically Conductive Acrylic Thickness: 2.6 Mil; 1.4 Mil of Copper Film and 1.2 Mil Conductive Adhesive Temperature Rating: 155 Degrees F Liner: Paper Tensile Strength: 25 lbs./in. Adhesion to steel: 35 oz./in. Shielding Effectiveness: 60db – 80db&rdquo;</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PdPHEazWL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
