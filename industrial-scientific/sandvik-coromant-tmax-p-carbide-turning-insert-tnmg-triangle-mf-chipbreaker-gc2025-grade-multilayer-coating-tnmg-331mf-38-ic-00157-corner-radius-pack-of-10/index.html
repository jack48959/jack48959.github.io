GC2025 grade is an MTCVD coating of titanium carbonitride (TiCN), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and titanium nitride (TiN) that provides a balance of resistance to shock and wear
Triangle shape is suitable for light roughing and finishing, and is used when there is limited machine power, a tendency toward vibration, or when either a large or small lead angle is required
Roughing (MR, PR), medium-machining (MM, QM), and finishing (MF) chipbreaker styles reduce buildup of chips at a range of cutting depths and feed rates
Negative double-sided insert has zero degree clearance and a strong edge for external turning</p><p>The Sandvik Coromant TNMG GC2025 indexable turning insert with a choice of MR, PR, MM, QM, or MF chipbreaker style has a triangle shape with a 60-degree cutting angle, providing a balance of resistance to shock and wear for roughing to finishing of stainless steel in average machining conditions. This double-sided negative insert has chip grooves on both sides, a hole in the center and six cutting edges. It has strong edges, zero clearance, and is a better choice for external turning than a positive insert. GC2025 grade is a combination of carbide and a coating of titanium carbonitride (TiCN), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), and titanium nitride (TiN) applied through medium temperature chemical vapor deposition (MTCVD), which provides both toughness and hardness for a balance of resistance to shock and wear. Resistance to thermal and mechanical shock combined with edge strength make this grade suitable for interrupted cuts. MTCVD coatings are deposited at lower temperatures than CVD coatings. The lower temperatures reduce cracks in the coating and provide increased toughness and smoothness without limiting wear resistance. The coating also provides shock resistance during interrupted cuts.
The TNMG GC2025 is available with a choice of five types of chipbreakers: MR, PR, MM, QM, or MF, for a range of cutting depths and feed rates. The MR and PR chipbreakers are designed for roughing operations and should be chosen when high removal rate is a priority. The PR chipbreaker has a higher range of cutting depths and feed rates than the MR chipbreaker. The MM and QM chipbreakers are designed for medium machining cutting depths and feed rates. The QM chipbreaker should be chosen over the MM chipbreaker when machining stability is a priority. The MF chipbreaker is designed for finishing operations and for use with gummy materials.
Tolerance of the distance from the base to the tip of the triangle is + or - 0.002” to 0.005”. Tolerance of the theoretical diameter of the insert is + or - 0.002” to 0.005”. Insert thickness tolerance is + or - 0.005”. Different insert shapes and sizes may have different inscribed circle (iC) measurements, which are related to the insert’s range of cutting depths, speeds, lead angle, and feed rates. The inscribed circle is the largest circle that can be drawn within the edges of the insert shape. In general, as the insert size and iC become larger, the maximum cutting depth increases. The cutting depth influences the metal removal rate, number of cuts, chip evacuation, and power required when using the insert.
Indexable inserts are small cutting tools designed to remove material in external and internal cutting applications such as turning, milling, drilling, and grooving. They are held by an insert holder, have multiple cutting edges, and can be rotated when one edge wears down. Multiple inserts can be used to accomplish a variety of cuts in one operation. An insert is either positive or negative, which refers to the rake or clearance angle at which the insert removes material. Inserts are coded according to their specific cutting and application capability (e.g. VNMG 16 04 04-QM). Each part of the code represents details of the insert shape, nose angle, clearance, tolerance, size, geometry, grade, and chipbreaker style.
Sandvik Coromant manufactures tools for turning, milling, and drilling. The company, headquartered in Sweden, makes tools used throughout the metalworking field, including the automotive and aerospace, die and mold, and general engineering industries. Sandvik Coromant inserts meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.
Matching Inserts to Holders
These inserts are part of the Sandvik Coromant TMax P Negative Insert family, which means they can be used with CoroTurn RC, a clamp-style insert holding system. This system is for use when stability and security are essential for productive turning of large components. The system is mostly used for external turning, from roughing to finishing, but also for internal turning.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cjiFKg08L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/sandvik-coromant-tmax-p-carbide-turning-insert-tnmg-triangle-mm-chipbreaker-gc2035-grade-multilayer-coating-tnmg-333mm-38-ic-00472-corner-radius-pack-of-10/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandvik Coromant T-Max P Carbide Turning Insert, TNMG, Triangle, MM Chipbreaker, GC2035 Grade, Multi-Layer Coating, TNMG 333-MM, 3/8 iC, 0.0472 Corner Radius (Pack of 10)">&larr;
