Female coupler connection on one end and male adapter on the other
Aluminum body with brass cam arms for corrosion and abrasion resistance and light weight
For use with water, hydraulic oil, coolants, gasoline, and petroleum products
Complies with Commercial Item Description A-A-59326D for quick disconnect fittings</p><p>This PT Coupling CXA Series cam and groove short reducer coupler to adapter hose fitting has an aluminum body, brass cam arms, a buna-n gasket, and a coupler to adapter connection. This fitting connects a female coupler on one end to a male adapter cam and groove-style hose fitting on the other. It is a short reducer fitting which means the diameter on one side of the fitting is smaller, and the body of the fitting is shorter than standard fittings. This fitting has an aluminum body which is light weight and resistant to corrosion and abrasion, and is suitable for use with water, hydraulic oil, coolants, gasoline, and petroleum products. The brass cam arms provide strength and resist corrosion and serve as the mechanism by which the coupler locks into the adapter groove. The buna-n (buna nitrile) gasket provides a leak-tight seal and has high tensile strength, abrasion, tear, and compression set resistance. This cam and groove short reducer hose fitting complies with Commercial Item Description A-A-59326D for quick disconnect fittings and is suitable for applications such as water transport, fuel delivery, and wine transfer.
Hose fittings connect, control, change the direction of, and terminate the flow in piping and hose systems. They are made of brass, stainless steel, galvanized steel, and other materials that resist corrosion, pressure, and wear. Hose fittings have various types of connections, including threaded, barbed, push-to-connect, dry disconnect, and others including those based on internationally-accepted specifications. Hose fittings are used in systems such as air compressors, automatic manufacturing operations, aircraft controls, and tire installation in industries including agriculture, mining, road construction, firefighting, and aviation.
PT Coupling manufactures pneumatic and hydraulic hose fittings for industrial and automotive applications. The company, founded in 1951 and headquartered in Enid, OK, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91vysoIs0ML._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/pt4010030-unidapt-unidapt-connectorrg58/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PT-4010-030 - UNIDAPT - Unidapt Connector/RG58">&larr;
