In fact, knowing what is on a cable before plugging in can protect valuable equipment and speed up new installations. The Power Panel Cat5/5e/6/6a/7/8 DVM is the right tool at the right time because once connected, it goes to work scanning each pin on a connector and displaying both the activity and the pair location (Network devices, phones or Power over Ethernet). And, if you are a VoIP phone or IP camera installer, you will find the Power Panel Cat5/5e/6/6a/7/8 DVM particularly useful because you will know if there is power and a data pair available for your equipment - exactly what you need to make your device operate. This Tone Star unit (POE1000ILT) is packed with features for sensing what is on a CAT5/6 cable; switches, phones, PoE power, plus interacts with these devices plus the ability to connect between 2 devices &ldquo;inline&rdquo;. Inline connections allow passing PoE power to the device monitoring the device while it is ON. Also, the inline Power Panel measures and displays power draw (in watts). In addition, this unit includes Triplett&rsquo;s full featured, filtered probe. The probe is used as a wire locator to audibly trace the tone placed on the wires by the Power Panel main unit. It features a tone button, volume control, ultrabright LED lighted tip, and 2 status LEDs; One to visually identify the tone and the other to warn you that there is 60hz present in the area. Also, filtered to minimize fluorescent hum. Includes: Power Panel (inline), Lighted Probe, pouch, patch cord, and two 9V batteries. Founded in 1904, U.S.-based Triplett Test Equipment continues to be on the leading edge of specialized testers. Whether supplying vital test equipment to the U.S. Signal Corps during WWII, or providing the railroad industry with essential testers to ensure the safety of their crews and the public, Triplett prides itself on developing innovative, reliable, and durable test equipment that also won&rsquo;t break the bank. Triplett&rsquo;s catalog contains a wide array of test equipment parts and accessories such as multimeters, voltmeters, cable testers, security cameras and security camera accessories, wire cable mapping kits, video monitors, and other specialty testers. They serve industries such as HVAC, security, electronics and electrical, telecom, and more.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hWdqqpXiL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
