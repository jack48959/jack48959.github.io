Cylindrical shape with end cut (shape B) for chamfering and for machining with the side and end of the tool on flat surfaces

1/4" shank diameter</p><p>The Pferd Alu Cut clog-resistant single-cut carbide bur has a cylindrical shape with an end cut, an uncoated (bright) finish, and a 1/4" shank diameter, and is for use on nonferrous metal such as aluminum and aluminum alloys, and plastic. The Alu Cut design is clog resistant with larger flutes than a standard single-cut bur for high stock removal and efficient chip evacuation on nonferrous metal and plastic. The bur has a cylindrical shape with an end cut, also known as shape B, which is suitable for chamfering and for machining with the side and end of the tool on flat surfaces. Carbide provides good wear resistance and maintains sharp edges longer than high-speed steel (HSS). With no coating or surface treatment, uncoated carbide supports a range of general-purpose applications. In most applications, burs should be operated within the recommended cutting speed range, expressed in surface feet per minute (SFPM).
Cutting burs, also called rotary files, are small rotary tools with many cutting edges that operate at very high speeds in order to remove material from a workpiece. The bur’s head contains the cutting edges, and the bur’s shank is inserted like a drill bit into a toolholder such as a drill chuck or collet. Burs are versatile tools that are offered in many shapes, sizes, and end types, and they are used in a wide range of industries, including tool, die, and mold manufacturing; metal fabrication; and dentistry. Burs can be used for deburring, or removing small protrusions (burrs) that form on the surface of a workpiece as a result of a machining process. They can also be used for welding preparation, finishing welded joints, chamfering, surface cleaning and finishing, grinding down rough edges, and contouring. A bur’s compact size gives the operator control over contact between the bur and the workpiece, making the tool well suited for delicate operations. Finishes or coatings may be applied to the head of the tool to improve wear resistance, decrease friction, and protect against high temperatures.
