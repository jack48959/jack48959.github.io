Combination electrode with a single-junction silver chloride (Ag/Cl) reference that uses a viscolene electrolyte to minimize clogging
PVDF body resists solvents, acids, bases, and heat
Measurement range is 0 to 12 pH
Electrode has a 75mm long probe with a 6mm diameter conical tip and a 1m cable with either a BNC or DIN connector for attaching to compatible meters</p><p>The Hanna Instruments series FC 200 food-specific electrode measures pH from 0 to 12 of milk, yogurt, dairy products, and semi-solid foods, and it has an open, single-junction silver chloride (Ag/Cl) reference with a viscolene electrolyte to minimize clogging. It can withstand up to 0.1 bar pressure, and it has a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) body that resists solvents, acids, bases, and heat. The electrode has a 75mm long probe with a conical tip that is 6mm in diameter. It has a 1m cable with either a Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) connector or a 7-pin Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN)-compliant connector for attaching to meters with compatible connections, including Hanna Instrument&rsquo;s HI 98140, HI 98150, HI 98230 and HI 98240 pH meters. The electrode&rsquo;s recommended operating temperature range is 20 to 40 degrees C (68 to 104 degrees F). pH electrodes measure the acidity or alkalinity of a substance and are commonly used by researchers, manufacturers, and hobbyists in hydroponics, aquaculture, agriculture, and wine-making, among other applications.
An electrode, also called a sensor or probe, is an instrument used with a meter to test and measure parameters of a substance. All electrodes are probes or sensors, but not all probes are electrodes or sensors. Probes, such as temperature probes, are used to penetrate a material for measurement. Common electrode types are pH, total dissolved solid (TDS), oxidation reduction potential (ORP), and ion selective electrode (ISE). They come in standard models or in all-in-one (sometimes called 3-in-1) models, which have a built-in temperature sensor for automatic temperature compensation (ATC). Electrodes can be half-cell or full- (also called combination) cell type. They can be refillable or non-refillable. Housing material is typically glass or epoxy, and sensors are commonly made with stainless steel or a glass bulb. pH electrodes, which measure the pH of a substance, often have a glass bulb. The bulb senses hydrogen ions, and generates a millivoltage that is picked up by the filling solution and transferred to a wire that connects to the pH meter. ORP, also known as redox, electrodes measure dissolved oxygen in aqueous solutions to determine the level of contaminants and their ability to act as oxidizing or reducing agents. Ion selective electrodes (ISEs) respond selectively to ions in the presence of other ions. Electrodes are commonly used by researchers, manufacturers, and hobbyists in a wide variety of industries, such as aquaculture, agriculture, chemistry, food and beverage, wine-making and water-testing, and for scientific applications. An electrode can be used with a datalogger to assist in temperature measurement.
Hanna Instruments manufactures analytical instrumentation and supplies, including pH meters, electrodes, chemical reagents, and buffer solutions. The company, founded in 1978 and headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 standards.
