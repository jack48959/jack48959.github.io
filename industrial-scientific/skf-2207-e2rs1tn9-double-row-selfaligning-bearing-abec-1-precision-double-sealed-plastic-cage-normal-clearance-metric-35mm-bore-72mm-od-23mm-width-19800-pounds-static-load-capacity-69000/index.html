Optimized internal design for a higher load rating than standard SKF self-aligning bearings
NBR rubber seal on both sides of the bearing keeps lubricant in and contaminants out
Polyamide 66 plastic cage evenly spaces balls for reduced friction, vibration, and noise
Normal radial internal clearance for applications where thermal expansion is not a factor</p><p>This SKF double-row self-aligning ball bearing is double-sealed, and has an optimized internal design, cylindrical bore, reinforced polyamide cage, and normal clearance rating. It is suitable for applications supporting moderate radial loads and moderate to low thrust loads. This bearing has concave sphered housing rings to compensate for static angular misalignments between the shaft and housing in applications subject to shaft deflections or mounting errors. Because this bearing type has the lowest operational friction of all rolling bearings, it runs cool at high speeds. The bearing is made of low-alloy, through-hardened chromium steel for durability and resistance to deformity under heavy loads. Due to its optimized internal design, an SKF bearing with an E suffix has a higher load rating than a standard SKF bearing of comparable size. This bearing has a straight bore for fitting on a conventional cylindrical shaft. Sheet-steel reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene (NBR) rubber seals on both sides of the bearing keep out contaminants such as dirt and grime and hold in lubricant applied at manufacture. The permissible operating temperature range of NBR is from -40 to 120 degrees C (-40 to 250 degrees F). This bearing has an injection molded snap-type cage made of polyamide 66 to prevent the balls from coming into contact with each other during use, reducing friction, vibration, and noise. This cage type can be used at operating temperatures up to 120 degrees C (250 degrees F). The bearing has a normal radial internal clearance designation, making it suitable for applications where the load and speeds do not result in thermal expansion. This clearance provides latitude for self-realignment and compensates for static and dynamic alignment errors. Additionally, the bearing is manufactured to normal tolerances in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 492:2002 specifications. This self-aligning ball bearing is for use in commercial and industrial applications including film processing equipment, office automation, vertical spinning equipment, and industrial countershafts, among others.
Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
SKF manufactures bearings, seals, and lubrication systems for automotive, OEM, energy, and other and industrial applications. The company, founded in 1907, is headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, and meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) TS 16949 and 9001 standards for quality assurance.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81PyZQjUN0L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/skf-22208-ec3-explorer-spherical-roller-bearing-straight-bore-standard-tolerance-steel-cage-c3-clearance-metric-40mm-bore-80mm-od-23mm-width-11000rpm-maximum-rotational-speed-22000lbf-stati/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SKF 22208 E/C3 Explorer Spherical Roller Bearing, Straight Bore, Standard Tolerance, Steel Cage, C3 Clearance, Metric, 40mm Bore, 80mm OD, 23mm Width, 11000rpm Maximum Rotational Speed, 22000lbf Stati">&larr;
