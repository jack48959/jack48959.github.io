The Scotch-Brite Hand Pad PRO Advantage
Scotch-Brite PRO is a unique surface conditioning product with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon fibers. Breakthrough fiber coating technology allows Scotch-Brite PRO abrasive products to cut faster and produce a more consistent scratch than competitive non-woven abrasive products, reducing the time and effort it takes to finish parts. Combining abrasives with the fibers gives you an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material is load resistant and keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the nylon fibers.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11QIkko0qtL.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/scotchbrite-radial-bristle-brush-replacement-disc-tc-120-refill-6-in-with-keyway/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scotch-Brite Radial Bristle Brush Replacement Disc, T-C 120 Refill, 6 in with Keyway">&larr;
