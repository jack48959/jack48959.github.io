Meets Deutsches Institut fur Normung (DIN) 2270, and Norme Francaise (French Institute for Standardization) NF E 11-053 standards, and includes a declaration of conformity</p><p>The Brown & Sharpe TESA Interapid 312 series dial test indicator has a white face, a 0.157" stem diameter, and inch measurements. The white dial and contrasting black hand help make measurements easy to read, and the dial face rotates to allow horizontal and vertical measurements. The carbide, ball-contact tip reaches into the workpiece for accurate measurements of turned, milled, and ground parts, and for tool setting gauges, fixtures, and inspections. The continuous clockwise pointer rotation and a revolution counter prevent plus or minus confusion. The ball-bearing lever system swivels through to 210 degrees. The dial face is mounted at a right angle to the insert&rsquo;s axis for mounting horizontally or vertically from the front or back of the indicator. A dovetail mount on the back of the indicator provides a rigid setup, and a 4mm swiveling shank on the front of the indicator can be mounted at a range of angles. This indicator has a Monoblock body design with pinions mounted in jeweled bearings in an isolated assembly separate from the outer body, for high accuracy. It has full-metal construction for durability and corrosion resistance. This dial test indicator meets Deutsches Institut fur Normung (DIN) 2270, and Norme Francaise (French Institute for Standardization) NF E 11-053 standards, and includes a declaration of conformity. The set includes an Interapid 312 dial test indicator, a 0.080" (2mm) ball-end carbide contact point, a point key, a Certificate of Accuracy and Traceability, and a storage box.
Dial readings with three digits, such as 0-10-0, signify that the indicator has a balanced dial. Dial readings with two digits, such as 0-100, indicate that the dial has a continuous dial. Balanced dials are used to read the difference from a specific surface reference point. Continuous dials are used for direct readings and usually have a larger measurement range than balanced dials.
Dial indicators are also called dial gauges, dial calipers, and probe indicators. These precision measuring tools are used to accurately measure small linear distances and object sizes. The dial magnifies the measurement so that it can more easily be read by the human eye. Frequently used in manufacturing, laboratories, and other industrial or mechanical fields, dial indicators are used anywhere a small measurement must be found and recorded or transferred, such as checking the variation in tolerance of a workpiece. Standard dial indicators measure the displacement along the axis of the indicator. Dial test indicators are very similar to dial indicators, except that the axis of measurement is perpendicular to the axis of the indicator. Dial and dial test indicators can be analog, with a mechanical dial, or electronic, with a digital display. Some electronic models transfer the data electronically to a computer for recording and potential manipulation.
Brown & Sharpe manufactures precision measuring equipment and metrology hand tools. The company, founded in 1833, played a key role in setting industrial standards in the United States. Brown & Sharpe was acquired by Hexagon Metrology in 2001 and is headquartered in North Kingstown, RI.
