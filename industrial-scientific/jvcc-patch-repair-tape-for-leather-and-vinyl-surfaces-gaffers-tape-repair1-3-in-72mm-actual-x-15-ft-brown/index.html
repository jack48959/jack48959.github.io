PLEASE READ: Many seating surfaces have accumulated oils, detergents, polishes, and miscellaneous other surfactants that will prevent pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes from forming a bond. Please try testing the surface with any available comparable adhesive tape (masking, gaffers, or other) prior to purchasing this product to see if this could possibly work for you. If that other tape does not adhere you can try cleaning the substrate first with a damp cloth and then allowing to dry completely.
If it still does not stick, then you might need one of the liquid seat repair products available on the market instead (these products would also be less noticeable than a tape repair). Tape rolls are typically cut to standard tape industry metric-cut sizes - or approx 5% narrower than the nominal size (i.e. 24mm per 1-inch of nominal width ordered).
JVCC REPAIR-1 leather and vinyl repair tape (gaffers tape) is available in various colors. Colored vinyl repair tape is especially useful when you need to match a certain shade. All the colors have a matte finish. If you need a shinier tape, see JVCC REPAIR-2HD, which is made from polyethylene-coated cloth duct tape. This tape is primarily used indoors but can be used outdoors over short time periods (the tape does not offer any type of UV-protection).
Adhesive: rubber. Carrier/Backing: vinyl-coated cloth. Thickness: 11 mils (carrier, adhesive). Adhesion: 60 ounces per inch (to stainless steel test panel). Tensile Strength: 48 pounds per inch (longitudinal). Core: 1-inch diameter.</p><p>JVCC REPAIR-1 Leather amp; Vinyl Repair Tape is a strong vinyl-coated cloth tape coated with an aggressive adhesive used for leather and vinyl sofa and seat repair. Offered in both 2 quot; nominal (1.88 quot; actual) and for larger tears needing wider tape a 3 quot; nominal (2.83 quot; actual) rolls. Roll lengths are 15 feet (5 yards) so if you don&rsquo;t want to buy a full length gaffers tape roll, which might take you years to use up, this is a great alternative. On the other hand, if you are using the tape to make a patch, this should provide plenty of material so it can be replaced as needed. Can be used for tears, rips, patch or cover concealment, color coding, arts amp; craft projects and a multitude of other uses and applications. This is the tape we most often sell for school bus seat repair. For the cleanest finish we suggest using a razor blade to cut the tape even though the tape is hand-tearable. Now comes in 10 colors: black, brown, burgundy, dark blue, dark green, gray, olive drab, red, tan and white. JVCC REPAIR-1 has a more matte finish since it is made form vinyl-coated cloth gaffers tape; if you want a tape with a shinier appearance please see JVCC&rsquo;s REPAIR-2HD product which is made from polyethylene-coated cloth duct tape.
