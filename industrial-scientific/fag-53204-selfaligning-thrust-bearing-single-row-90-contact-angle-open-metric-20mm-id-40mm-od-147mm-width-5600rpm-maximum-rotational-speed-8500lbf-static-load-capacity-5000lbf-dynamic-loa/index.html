Self-aligning bearing with sphered housing rings to compensate for static angular misalignments between the shaft and housing
Through-hardened chromium steel for durability and resistance to deformity under heavy loads
Sheet steel retainer evenly spaces rollers for reduced friction, vibration, and noise
Grooved raceways for higher speeds and thrust-bearing capacity than flat washers</p><p>This FAG single-row self-aligning thrust ball bearing has a 90-degree contact angle and an open construction. It is suitable for moderate-speed applications that support heavy axial loads in one direction and no radial loads. This deep-groove thrust ball bearing consists of a spherical housing locating washer (ring), a shaft locating washer, and a ball and cage assembly. The washers have grooved raceways that conform to the balls rotating between them, allowing higher speeds and thrust bearing capacity than bearings with flat raceways. The bearing is self-aligning with a spherical-shaped housing washer that helps compensate for static angular misalignments between the shaft and housing. The single-row design supports thrust loads in a single direction and tolerates axial deflection, and the open construction allows for the bearing to be lubricated in place. This bearing has a 90-degree contact angle in which the ball and inner and outer raceway contact points are on a plane parallel to the axial load, which enables the bearing to receive high axial force. The balls and washers are made of a low-alloy, through-hardened chromium steel for durability, heat tolerance, and resistance to deformity under heavy loads, and the sheet steel cage prevents the balls from coming into contact with each other during use, reducing friction, vibration, and noise. This bearing is separable so it mounts more easily than nonseparable bearings because its components can be installed independently. It can be used at operating temperatures from -30 degrees C to 150 C (-22 degrees F to 302 F). This thrust ball bearing has a PN (normal) tolerance class rating for dimensional accuracy and is suitable for applications including machine tool drive shafts, automotive steering gears and clutches, rotary tables, outboard motor propellers, and household appliances.

Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
FAG manufactures a variety of bearings that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) standards for quality assurance. The company, founded in 1883, is based in Schweinfurt, Germany.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/813SFSJOj2L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/fag-6309rsrc3-radial-bearing-single-row-abec-1-precision-single-seal-steel-cage-c3-clearance-metric-45mm-id-100mm-od-25mm-width-4500rpm-maximum-rotational-speed-7100lbf-static-load-capacit/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FAG 6309RSR-C3 Radial Bearing, Single Row, ABEC 1 Precision, Single Seal, Steel Cage, C3 Clearance, Metric, 45mm ID, 100mm OD, 25mm Width, 4500rpm Maximum Rotational Speed, 7100lbf Static Load Capacit">&larr;
