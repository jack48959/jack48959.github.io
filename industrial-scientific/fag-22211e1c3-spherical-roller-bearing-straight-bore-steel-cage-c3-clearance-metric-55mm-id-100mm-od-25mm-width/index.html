Straight bore fits conventional cylindrical shafts</p><p>This FAG E1 Series spherical roller bearing has a steel cage, a C3 radial clearance, an outer ring with lubrication groove and 3 oil holes, and a straight bore suitable for applications that support high radial and oscillating axial loads, such as in a wind turbine. Its rollers, cage, and rings conform to Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN) P5 precision standard for performance within a narrow range of variation. The inner ring is hardened and the pressed steel cage has high wear resistance and spaces the oversize rollers for even load distribution and prevents contact to reduce friction, vibration, and noise. Its C3 radial clearance is larger than normal for applications where impact loads and vibration are severe, or thermal expansion is a factor. The bearing&rsquo;s straight bore fits conventional cylindrical shafts. This bearing has two rows of symmetrically arranged rollers oriented on a concave raceway, which allow self-realignment and compensate for static and dynamic alignment errors. The bearing has a maximum operating temperature of 392 degrees F. This roller bearing is intended for interchangeability and meets DIN standards for parts numbering, bearing dimensions, load ratings, tolerances, and clearances. It meets International Standards Organization (ISO) standards for hardening of bearing rollers and rings. This spherical roller bearing is suitable for use in material handling equipment, electric generators, and machine tools.

Roller bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All roller bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
FAG manufactures a variety of bearings that meet International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung (DIN) standards for quality assurance. The company, founded in 1883, is based in Schweinfurt, Germany.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WDwrZzUjL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/fag-30210a-tapered-roller-bearing-cone-and-cup-set-standard-tolerance-metric-50-mm-id-90mm-od-2175mm-width-7500rpm-maximum-rotational-speed/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="FAG 30210A Tapered Roller Bearing Cone and Cup Set, Standard Tolerance, Metric, 50 mm ID, 90mm OD, 21.75mm Width, 7500rpm Maximum Rotational Speed">&larr;
