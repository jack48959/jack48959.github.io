They are specially designed to be low maintenance and are proven to be extra durable for belt life that will outlast the competition. Cutting down maintenance and keeping your machines running at full capacity means you save time and money.
Our X3 belts are created to carry a high load capacity. Extensive durability testing, certified by a major USA University Department of Mechanical Engineering, shows belt life that continues to outperform the competition. The X3 belts can carry a high capacity so that you can often use fewer belts on a drive resulting in space and cost savings.
The belts are constructed of highly engineered, high performance components. The components are manufactured using the latest in belt technology available on a global basis. The outer fabric wrap is treated with oil and heat resistant, engineered synthetic rubber compound, specifically compounded for excellent wear resistance, proven through thousands of hours of testing. The helically wound tensile cords are specially engineered, twisted, heat and chemically set, pre-stretched polyester material. Testing has proven that the tensile decay properties of BESTORQ Cord are truly World Class. The body rubber compound is a highly engineered synthetic rubber compound, specially compounded for cool running, flexibility, crack resistance, and excellent bonding to the outer fabric and tensile cords. The belts exceed USA RMA published ratings levels. They are designed to perform at the identical or higher level than all other major USA Manufacturer’s belts of the same type.
Due to superior chemistry and optimized belt design, the X3 belts lose less energy due to bending than any competitor wrapped uncogged belts.
Bestorq was incorporated in 2006 and brings over 81 years of combined engineering experience to help even the toughest application.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61z0kVyv9lL._SL1080_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
