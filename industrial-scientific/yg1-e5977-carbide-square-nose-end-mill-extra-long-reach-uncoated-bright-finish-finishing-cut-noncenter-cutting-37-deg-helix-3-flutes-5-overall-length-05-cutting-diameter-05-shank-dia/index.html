Carbide can run at higher speeds than high-speed or cobalt steel, resisting wear and high cutting temperatures</p><p>The YG-1 E5977 uncoated carbide extended-reach square nose end mill has a 37-degree helix angle, three flutes, and low surface roughness on the cutting edge for high-performance machining on aluminum and other nonferrous materials. The extended-reach neck style provides greater access to recessed areas of the workpiece than tools with a standard neck style. The 37-degree helix angle provides more support behind the cutting edge than higher angles, and increases cutting action and chip evacuation compared to the standard 30-degree helix. The end millâ€™s three flutes provide better chip-carrying capacity than four flutes and a finer finish than two. They efficiently remove excess material from the cutting area and provide a third cutting edge to create an improved finish that may eliminate the need for a second finishing cut in some applications. The cutting edge is treated with extra grinding passes, minimizing surface roughness and creating a low-friction surface to help prevent chips from sticking to the tool. The toolâ€™s square end creates sharp, unrounded cuts. The center-cutting design has cutting teeth at the end of the tool, so it can be fed into the workpiece like a drill bit.
Carbide is harder than high-speed or cobalt steel, making it more wear resistant at high speeds and providing longer tool life. This tool has no coating or surface treatment. Cutting diameter tolerance is + 0.0000 to - 0.0005". The round shank accommodates a range of tool holders.
End mills are designed to remove material and create multi-dimensional shapes and profiles. They have cutting edges along the outside diameter and flutes that remove chips from the cutting area and allow cooling fluids to enter. If heat is not reduced effectively, the toolâ€™s cutting edges will dull and additional material buildup can occur. The number of flutes can range from two to eight. Two-flute designs offer the most efficient chip removal, but more flutes provide a smoother finish. The shank is the end of the tool held in place by a tool holder or machine. Center-cutting end mills can create three-dimensional shapes and profiles, and make plunge cuts similar to a drill bit. Non-center-cutting end mills are for applications such as peripheral milling and finishing, but cannot make plunge cuts.
YG-1 manufactures drills, taps, end mills, and rotary tooling. The company, founded in 1981, is headquartered in South Korea and has a U.S. office in Vernon Hills, IL.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51OkmMkZYsL._SL1241_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
