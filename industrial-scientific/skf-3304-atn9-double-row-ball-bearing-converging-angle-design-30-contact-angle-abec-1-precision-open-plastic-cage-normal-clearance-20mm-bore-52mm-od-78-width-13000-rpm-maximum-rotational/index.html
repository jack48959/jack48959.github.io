Ball contact angle of 30 degrees relative to the inner and outer raceways increases thrust load capacity
Open configuration for lubrication applied in place
Polyamide 66 plastic cage evenly spaces balls for reduced friction, vibration, and noise
P6 precision rating for high accuracy, high rotational speeds, and increased operating efficiency</p><p>This SKF Explorer 33 A series double-row angular contact ball bearing is an open bearing, and has a 30-degree contact angle, reinforced polyamide cage, normal clearance rating, and P6 precision rating. It supports radial loads, thrust loads in both directions, and combined loads, and occupies less axial space than a pair of single-row angular contact ball bearings mounted together. Because the two rows of rolling elements are mounted back-to-back, the bearing arrangement is relatively rigid and can accommodate tilting moments. The 33 A series does not have filling slots and has a larger cross section than the 32 A series, making it suitable for heavier loads and slower speeds. This bearing is made of low-alloy, through-hardened carbon chromium steel for durability and resistance to deformity under heavy loads. SKF Explorer bearings are manufactured under SKF&rsquo;s improved engineering processes, resulting in a longer service life, higher dynamic load carrying capacity, and a higher precision rating than standard SKF angular contact ball bearings. The 30-degree contact angle of the balls in relation to the raceways gives the bearing a greater capacity for supporting thrust loads over bearings with a standard contact angle of zero degrees. Its open design facilitates lubricating the bearing in place and dissipating heat. This bearing has an injection molded snap-type cage made of polyamide 66 to prevent the balls from coming into contact with each other during use, reducing friction, vibration, and noise. This cage type can be used at operating temperatures up to 120 degrees C (250 degrees F). The bearing has a normal axial internal clearance designation, making it suitable for applications where the load and speeds do not result in thermal expansion. This clearance provides latitude for self-realignment and compensates for static and dynamic alignment errors. Additionally, the bearing has a dimensional and running accuracy to tolerance class P6 in accordance with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 492:2002 for a higher level of precision than bearings manufactured to normal tolerances. ISO-rated ball bearings are manufactured to tight dimensional tolerances, making them useful in applications that require high accuracy, high rotational speeds, and increased operating efficiency. This angular contact ball bearing is for use in commercial and industrial applications including pumps and compressors, automotive drives, gearboxes, and printing machines, among others.
Rolling bearings use rolling elements to maintain the separation between moving parts to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. These elements can be one of the following types: ball, cylindrical, spherical, barrel, needle, spindle, or tapered. All rolling bearings are open, shielded, or sealed. Sealed bearings are lubricated with oil or grease in the bearing factory, while open and shielded bearings are meant to be lubricated in place, with periodic reapplication of lubrication, based on use. The shield protects the working parts of the bearing from environmental debris that may be introduced and could reduce the ball bearing speed and lifespan. Rolling bearings are used in a range of applications from agricultural machinery to conveying equipment, robotics, dental equipment, elevators, rolling mills, ship rudder shafts, and aggregate crushers, among others.
SKF manufactures bearings, seals, and lubrication systems for automotive, OEM, energy, and other and industrial applications. The company, founded in 1907, is headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden, and meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) TS 16949 and 9001 standards for quality assurance.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81QxZDdIi4L._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload"></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><hr class=m-0></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-12 offset-md-1 pt-4"><ul class="list-group list-group-horizontal" style=flex-direction:row><li class="list-group-item b-0 p-0"><a type=button class="btn btn-dark" role=button href=https://jack48959.github.io/industrial-scientific/skf-3305-atn9c3-angular-contact-bearing-double-row-25mm-x-62mm-x-254mm/ data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SKF 3305 ATN9/C3 Angular Contact Bearing Double Row 25mm X 62mm X 25.4mm">&larr;
