The thinning scissor is a type of hair scissor that provides an effective method for controlling exceptionally thick and uncooperative hair, and providing well-balanced haircuts. These scissors possess a number of teeth that allow them to cut some but not all strands of hair with each snip. As a result, they can remove some layers of hair from the head, while leaving other layers intact. The effect is too thin out the hair, leaving finer, more manageable locks. These scissors may remove as little as 30% of the hair with each cut, and as much as 70%. The scissors that possess more teeth and remove less hair work best for modifying haircuts and thinning straight hair. Those scissors that have fewer teeth and remove more hair work best for thinning curly hair. Thinning scissors also come in different lengths, with one of the most common being 6.5-inch scissors. For best results and a perfect haircut, hair should be washed and conditioned with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. A good quality comb is also handy. All suvorna products are backed by money back guarantee, So if you&rsquo;re not satisfied with the purchase for any reason, you may return it in original condition (unused) within 90 days for a full refund.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hyZP0NjEL._AC_SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
