What makes this fragrance so fantastic is that it smells equally as good as its designer counterpart and last much, much longer.
Most commercial scents are 90% alcohol, resulting in an intense initial experience followed by a quick and unsatisfying disappearance as the scent evaporates along with the alcohol. Our oil blends are less overpowering when initially applied but last longer as the oil does not evaporate but rather absorbs into the skin. You will be amazed at how smooth and luxurious the oil feels in comparison!
Our perfume Oils are smooth and glide on like silk, leaving the skin fragrant for hours. They are not like other perfumes that offer fragrance for a short time, go on sticky and greasy, or are full of chemicals. These Perfume Oils are only made from skin friendly ingredients to deliver a long lasting scent while also nurturing the skin.
Each fragrance is crafted from the highest quality ingredients. Tailor made, exquisitely simple, refined. Apply fragrance to your pulse points such as your wrists, neck, and chest area, where you desire scent. Reapply as needed. Highly scented and long lasting.</p><p>Perfume oils will enhance your mood and feelings of well-being. A feeling of pure luxury abounds when you use these perfume oils.
★ Our perfumes are made of concentrated fragrance in a base of lightweight organic oils. No alcohol to dry out your skin! They absorb quickly and leave no residue.
★ They also pamper and soften the skin with a nourishing formulation while delivering a fabulous fragrance experience.
★
