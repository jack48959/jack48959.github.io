Our hay bags were proudly designed in the USA and tested extensively.
PERFECT FOR GUINEA PIGS, RABBITS, CHINCHILLAS, AND MORE - these hay bags were designed for use with a wide variety of hay eating small animals. Our hay bags are sized to hold a generous amount of hay, and are safe for every day and long-term use.
NOT DESIGNED FOR HEAVY CHEWERS - some small pets will chew/eat fabric. For these pets, we recommend that you do not use a fabric hay feeder as they may try to ingest the fabric. Always monitor your pet and remove the hay bag if it becomes damaged.
AVAILABLE IN THREE DIFFERENT SIZES - this hay pouch is available in three sizes: Small (9" long x 11" tall x 1.5” wide), Medium (18" long x 11" tall x 1.5” wide), and Large (15" long x 15" tall x 5” wide), to best suit you and your pet&rsquo;s needs!
AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE COLORS AND PATTERNS - our fun and colorful small pet hay feeders are available in the colors Black, Hurricane Blue, Pink, Purple, Green, and Rainbow Geometry so that you can find the perfect bag to match your pet&rsquo;s cage.</p><p>CuteNfuzzy&rsquo;s line of small pet hay feeders are meticulously designed and tested here in the USA. We&rsquo;re proud to have created a line of attractive, high-quality, innovative, long-lasting, and best-selling hay feeders designed for use with any small pet such as guinea pigs, rabbits, chinchillas, degus, and even reptiles such as tortoises! These bags are designed for easy, hassle-free, waste-free, and mess-free hay feeding. Unlike traditional wooden, plastic, or metal hay feeders that are intrusive, heavy, hard to fill, and can become dangerous for your pet, our feeders are completely safe and easy to use. Each of our small pet hay bags features a pair of high-quality stainless steel trigger snaps that make hanging this bag a breeze, as well as a d-ring on the back so you can anchor the bag to your cage wall to prevent your pet from moving or flipping it. Our bags also have a full velcro closing top to prevent hay spillage. You&rsquo;ll love how much less hay is wasted and how much cleaner your pet&rsquo;s cage stays with our hay bags! Our feeders were designed to be as hygienic as possible by keeping your hay dry and unsoiled. These bags are also easy to clean and feature a waterproof inner lining. All of the seams on these bags are sturdily reinforced for maximum longevity. Small animals have teeth that never stop growing, so they need to constantly chew in order to keep their teeth from becoming overgrown. Some pets are heavier chewers than others, and while most will not chew fabric, some pets may shred, rip, or eat fabric. For the pets who do this, we do not recommend the use of a fabric hay bag for them as they could try to ingest the fabric. Please take your pet’s individual personality, needs, and safety into consideration when choosing a hay feeder for them. We recommend keeping your hay bag full and not letting it become empty for lengths of time in order to lessen the risk of them eating the fabric. If your hay bag becomes damaged, immediately discontinue using it.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71F2lInC4fL._AC_SL1200_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
