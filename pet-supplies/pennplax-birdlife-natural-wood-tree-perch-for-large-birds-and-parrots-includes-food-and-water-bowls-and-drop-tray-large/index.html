Food And Water Bowls: Our Wooden Tree Perches come with 2 stainless steel cups that can be used to snack-n-perch. They can hold food, water, seed, or your little one’s favorite snack! Both food bowls screw into the top branch, and can be removed for a quick clean, or as needed.
TAPERED DESIGN: This bird perch features 2 tapered real wood branches that consist of various diameters, attached to the platform base. This design is inspired from the natural contours found on trees and other shrubbery. It also helps your bird exercise the gripping muscles of their feet and keeps nails trimmed. The bottom drop tray also helps keep everything together and prevents seeds from going everywhere.
