Tips and Tricks
How do I choose the correct bed?
K&amp;H is often asked what size bed to order based on your dog&rsquo;s or cat&rsquo;s breed. This would be hard to determine because each animal is different and sleeps in different configurations. Try examining how your pet often sleeps and even measuring the approximate space your little bundle of joy takes up in order to help choose the correct bed for their needs.
Special Care Instructions
The berber cover zips off and is machine washable. We recommend washing in cold water, tumble dry low or line dry.
