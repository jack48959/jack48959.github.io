BUILT TO LAST: Quality design, Built to withstand repeated use</p><p>Good grooming and proper hygiene are vital to every dog’s wellbeing. Keeping fleas at bay is an essential part of pet grooming, and the basic tool for this is the best dog flea comb. Fleas usually thrive around the dog’s ears and neck and on the tummy and the base of the tail. It would be difficult not to have a comb to wield around these areas. Aside from helping removing fleas, combs also make it easy to detect skin and coat problems. The UrbanX Flea Comb does these things exactly. It helps remove fleas and dirt and also helps detect skin disorders in their early stage. It also boasts contoured handle which makes it comfortable to hold while taking care of man’s best friend. There are many methods by which pet owners use this comb to give their dogs a more effective treatment. Some use it on their pet after each bath or after shampooing or applying flea powder. Others dip the UrbanX Flea Comb in apple cider vinegar or with warm soapy water or with mint oil and then comb away fleas. The pets just love the attention they get, and their owners accomplish a very important pet grooming task. Pet owners are not the only ones who think that this comb is a gem. Professional pet groomers and animal rescue volunteers, too, have been using this for so long now. They attest to its usefulness in helping removing fleas effectively. The rows of fine teeth make this comb several notches above the rest. Not only that, but it also leaves pets’ coats soft and shiny.</p></article></div></div><div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1"><div class="card-image card-image-blog p-0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7195+3i8kvL._SL1500_.jpg class="rounded img-fluid lazyload">
