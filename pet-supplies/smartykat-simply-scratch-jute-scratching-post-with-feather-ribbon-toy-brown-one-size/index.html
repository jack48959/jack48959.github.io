ABOUT US: SmartyKat products help pet owners meet basic feline needs; from scratchers and toys to edible grass and catnip, our products are designed to stimulate a particular feline need while fostering a stronger relationship between you and your cat</p><p>Our Simply Scratch Jute Scratching Post offers a natural, durable, and satisfying jute-wrapped post with a dangling feather toy for an extra kitty lure. Easy-to-assemble, cats love the satisfying texture of natural Jute and the feel-good body stretch they get gripping and ripping at this sturdy and durable scratch post. The instinct to scratch is hard-wired into cats; they scratch to mark territory and promote healthy nail growth, as well as stretch, tone muscles, and alleviate stress. SmartyKat&rsquo;s innovative cat scratchers offer various combinations of scratch surfaces and angles to please any cat and redirect natural scratching behavior away from furnishings. SmartyKat toys, beds and scratchers are designed to meet the needs of your cat: Exercise, Hunt, Stimulation, Interaction, Scratch and Comfort without forgetting about FUN!

That is why we design products to meet child safety standards; ensuring kids in the home are safe, whether they are two-footed or four-pawed! We utilize recycled and sustainable materials wherever possible. Please read all packaging instructions, warnings and cautions upon receipt.
