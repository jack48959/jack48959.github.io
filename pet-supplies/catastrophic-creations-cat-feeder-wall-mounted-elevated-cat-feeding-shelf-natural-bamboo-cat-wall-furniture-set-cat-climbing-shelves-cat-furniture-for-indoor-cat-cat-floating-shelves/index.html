This Shelf helps to reduce the strain on your cat&rsquo;s neck and joints while feeding. These cat Shelves are spacious and have a large 8.5 x 11 x 3-inch surface, which provides plenty of room to place food and water bowls.
Cat Safe Space: Adding the Feeder Cat Shelf wall also allows your cat to indulge his hunting instincts. When your cat navigates the furniture to get to their food, they are “foraging” for food as a wild cat does. It&rsquo;s a perfect gift for your furry friends and provides a convenient space-saving option for their needs.
