Walky Guard
The Walky Guard is quick and easy to assemble, without needing any tools. It’s easily adjustable to fit most vehicles fitted with extendable rear headrests. It can even be used with the parcel shelf still in place. Fast fitting headrest attachments mean it is easily moved from vehicle to vehicle. When you need the car for something other than canine transport, removing the Walky Guard is easy. Just loosen off the tightening knobs and remove from the headrest posts.
Safe & Clean
At day at the beach for your dog can mean a day at the detailers for your hatchback or SUV. The Walky Guard keeps your sandy dog in the back, away from your clean seats. It also keeps him safe in all types of automobile—not allowing him to jump from one area to another. The optional Walky Guard Mesh covers the gap between front seats.
High-Quality Construction
Walky Guard is made from high-quality powdered-coated steel. It can resist the advances of dogs of all sizes. The cleverly-designed telescopic bars allow for a perfect fit while the headrest attachments hold tight.
